# shell.darklab.sh

A lightweight web interface for running network diagnostic and vulnerability scanning commands against remote endpoints, with output streamed in real time. Designed for testing and troubleshooting remote hosts — DNS lookups, port scans, traceroutes, HTTP checks, web app scanning, and more — without needing SSH access to a server. Built with Python and Flask, designed to run in Docker.

---

## Features

- **Real-time output streaming** — output appears line by line as the process produces it, via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Kill running processes** — each tab has its own **■ Kill** button that appears while a command is running; clicking it shows a confirmation modal before sending SIGTERM to the entire process group. Killed processes show a **KILLED** status (amber) distinct from ERROR
- **Run timer** — a live elapsed timer runs next to the status pill while a command is executing; the final duration is shown in the exit line when the process finishes or is killed
- **Command allowlist** — restrict which commands can be run via a plain-text config file, no restart required
- **Shell injection protection** — blocks `&&`, `||`, `|`, `;`, backticks, `$()`, redirects (`>`, `<`), and direct references to `/data` or `/tmp` as filesystem paths, both client-side and server-side
- **Autocomplete with tab completion** — suggestions loaded from `auto_complete.txt` appear as you type; use **↑↓** to navigate, **Tab** or **Enter** to accept, **Escape** to dismiss
- **Tabs / multiple runs** — open multiple tabs to run commands in parallel or keep previous results visible; each tab tracks its own status
- **Run history drawer** — slide-out panel showing completed runs with timestamps and exit codes; click any entry to load its output into a new tab (with the command shown at the top), copy the command to clipboard, or copy a permalink. Persists across container restarts via SQLite
- **Permalinks** — the permalink button on each tab captures all output currently visible and saves it as a shareable HTML page; single-run permalinks from the history drawer link to individual run results. Both persist via SQLite
- **Output search** — search within the active tab's output with match highlighting and prev/next navigation
- **Command history** — recent commands shown as clickable chips for quick re-runs
- **Save output** — download the terminal output as a timestamped `.txt` file
- **Dark/light theme** — toggle between dark and light mode; preference saved in localStorage
- **MOTD** — optional message of the day displayed at the top of the terminal on page load
- **Configurable** — key behavioural settings (rate limits, retention, timeouts, branding, theme) controlled via `config.yaml`, no rebuild needed
- **Rate limiting** — per-IP request limiting via `X-Forwarded-For` header (compatible with nginx-proxy)
- **Logging** — each command start, finish, and kill is logged with run ID, session ID, PID, command, exit code, and elapsed time
- **FAQ modal** — built-in help including allowed commands and usage notes

## Quick Start

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

All app files live in the `./app/` subdirectory and are mounted as a read-only volume — edits to `config.yaml`, `allowed_commands.txt`, and `auto_complete.txt` take effect after a restart with no rebuild needed:

```bash
docker compose restart
```

A minimal standalone `docker-compose.yml` with no infrastructure-specific configuration is available in the `examples/` folder.

#### Read-only filesystem

The container filesystem is set to read-only (`read_only: true`) and the app volume is mounted read-only (`./app:/app:ro`). There are two intentional exceptions:

- **`/data`** — a writable bind mount for the SQLite database, owned by `appuser` with `chmod 700`. Only Gunicorn can write here; the `scanner` user that runs commands has no access
- **`/tmp`** — a `tmpfs` mount (in-memory, wiped on restart) used by tools that need scratch space for templates, sessions, and cache files

To prevent commands from writing to either path directly, the app blocks any command that references `/data` or `/tmp` as a filesystem argument (using a negative lookbehind so URLs containing `/data` or `/tmp` as path segments are still permitted).

#### Keep-Alive & Long-Running Commands

For commands that produce little or no output for extended periods (e.g. slow scans, nuclei running against a large target), the SSE connection is kept alive by a server-sent heartbeat comment sent every `heartbeat_interval_seconds` (default 20s) when no output is being produced. This prevents nginx and the browser from treating the idle connection as stale and dropping it.

The nginx-proxy timeout environment variables (`PROXY_READ_TIMEOUT`, `PROXY_SEND_TIMEOUT`, `PROXY_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`) in `docker-compose.yml` are set to 3600 seconds to match the Gunicorn worker timeout, giving commands up to an hour to complete. Commands can also be automatically killed after a configurable duration via `command_timeout_seconds` in `config.yaml`.

#### nginx-proxy & VIRTUAL_HOST

The `VIRTUAL_HOST` and `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` are specific to a [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) + [acme-companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion) setup for automatic reverse proxying and SSL. If you are not using nginx-proxy, remove these environment variables entirely.

If you are running this as a standalone Docker app without a reverse proxy, replace the `expose` section with a `ports` mapping:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8888:8888"
```

#### GELF Logging

The `logging` block in `docker-compose.yml` ships container logs to a Graylog instance via GELF UDP. This is specific to a self-hosted logging infrastructure and can be safely removed if you don't have a GELF-compatible log aggregator:

```yaml
# Remove this block if not using GELF logging
logging:
  driver: "gelf"
  options:
    gelf-address: "udp://loghost.darklab.sh:12201/"
```

Without this block, Docker will use its default `json-file` log driver.

#### Docker Networks

The `networks` block attaches the container to an external Docker network called `darklab-net`. This is required for the container to be reachable by nginx-proxy when both are on the same network. If you are not using a shared Docker network, remove the entire `networks` section and Docker will create a default bridge network automatically.

### Running Without Docker

A convenience script is available in `examples/run_local.sh` that installs dependencies and starts the app. Or run manually:

```bash
pip install flask gunicorn pyyaml
cd app
python3 app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). Note that without Docker, the installed security tooling (nmap, nuclei, etc.) and process isolation (`scanner` user, read-only filesystem) will not be in effect.

---

## Configuration

All application settings live in `app/config.yaml`. The file is read at startup — changes take effect after `docker compose restart` with no rebuild needed. If a setting is omitted, the default value is used.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `app_name` | `shell.darklab.sh` | Name shown in the browser tab, header, and permalink pages |
| `motd` | _(empty)_ | Optional message displayed at the top of the terminal on page load. Leave empty to disable |
| `default_theme` | `dark` | Default colour theme for new visitors. Options: `dark`, `light`. Overridden by the user's saved preference |
| `history_panel_limit` | `50` | Number of runs shown in the history drawer per session |
| `recent_commands_limit` | `8` | Number of recent commands shown as clickable chips below the input |
| `permalink_retention_days` | `0` | Delete runs and snapshots older than this many days on startup. `0` = unlimited |
| `rate_limit_per_minute` | `30` | Max `/run` requests per minute per IP |
| `rate_limit_per_second` | `5` | Max `/run` requests per second per IP |
| `max_output_lines` | `2000` | Max lines retained per tab. Oldest lines are dropped from the top when exceeded. `0` = unlimited |
| `command_timeout_seconds` | `0` | Auto-kill commands that run longer than this many seconds. `0` = disabled |
| `heartbeat_interval_seconds` | `20` | How often to send an SSE heartbeat on idle connections to prevent proxy timeouts |

---

## Installed Tools

The following tools are installed in the Docker image and available for use:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ping` | ICMP reachability |
| `curl` / `wget` | HTTP/HTTPS requests |
| `dig` / `nslookup` / `host` | DNS lookups |
| `whois` | Domain & IP registration info |
| `traceroute` / `tcptraceroute` | Route tracing (ICMP and TCP) |

| `gobuster` | Directory, file, DNS, and vhost brute-forcing. Wordlists installed at `/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/` |

---

## Command Allowlist

Allowed commands are controlled by `allowed_commands.txt`. The file is re-read on every request, so changes take effect immediately without restarting the server.

**Format:**
- One command prefix per line
- Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored
- Matching is prefix-based: a prefix of `ping` permits `ping google.com`, `ping -c 4 1.1.1.1`, etc.
- Be as specific or broad as you like — `nmap -sT` permits only TCP connect scans, while `nmap` permits any nmap invocation

**Example:**
```
ping
curl
dig
nmap
whois
```

To **disable restrictions entirely**, delete `allowed_commands.txt` or leave it empty — all commands will be permitted.

### Shell Operator Blocking

When the allowlist is active, the following operators are blocked outright, both in the browser and on the server, to prevent chaining disallowed commands:

`&&` `||` `|` `;` `;;` `` ` `` `$()` `>` `>>` `<`

---

## Autocomplete

Autocomplete suggestions are loaded from `auto_complete.txt` at page load and matched against what you type. The matched portion of each suggestion is highlighted in green.

**Keyboard controls:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **↑ / ↓** | Navigate through suggestions |
| **Tab** | Accept the highlighted suggestion (or the only match if one result) |
| **Enter** | Accept highlighted suggestion, or run the command if none selected |
| **Escape** | Dismiss the dropdown |

**Format** — same conventions as `allowed_commands.txt`:
- One suggestion per line
- Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored
- Suggestions can be full commands with flags, e.g. `nmap -sT --script vuln`

The file is fetched once on page load. To update suggestions, edit `auto_complete.txt` and reload the page — no server restart needed.

---

## Tool Notes

### mtr

`mtr` normally runs as a live, full-screen interactive display that continuously redraws in place using ncurses. This requires a real TTY, which is not available in a web-based shell environment.

To work around this, the app automatically rewrites any `mtr` command to use `--report-wide` mode when no report flag is already present:

| You type | What runs |
|----------|-----------|
| `mtr google.com` | `mtr --report-wide google.com` |
| `mtr -c 20 google.com` | `mtr --report-wide -c 20 google.com` |
| `mtr --report google.com` | unchanged — already in report mode |

### nmap

nmap's `--privileged` flag is automatically injected into every nmap command, telling nmap to use raw socket access (which it has via file capabilities set in the Dockerfile). This enables OS fingerprinting, SYN scans, and other features that would otherwise require running as root. Users do not need to add `--privileged` manually.

### wapiti

By default wapiti writes its report to a file in `/tmp`, which isn't accessible from the browser. The app automatically appends `-f txt -o /dev/stdout` to any `wapiti` command that doesn't already specify an output path, redirecting the report to the terminal so results appear inline with the scan output. If you want to specify your own output format or path, include `-o` in your command and the rewrite won't fire.

### nuclei

`nuclei` stores its template library and cache in `$HOME` by default. The app runs nuclei as the `scanner` user with `HOME=/tmp` so all nuclei writes go to the tmpfs mount. The `-ud /tmp/nuclei-templates` flag is automatically injected if not already present so templates are stored and reused across runs within the same container session. Templates are lost on container restart and re-downloaded on the first nuclei run, which takes 30–60 seconds.

---

## Tabs & Run History

Each command runs in the currently active tab. You can open additional tabs with the **+** button to run commands side by side and keep results from different sessions visible simultaneously. Each tab shows a coloured status dot (amber = running, green = success, red = failed, amber = killed) and is labelled with the last command that was run in it.

The **⧖ history** button opens a slide-out drawer showing the last 50 completed runs with timestamps and exit codes. Click any entry to load its output into a new tab — the command is shown at the top of the output as `$ <command>` followed by the results. Each entry also has two buttons: **copy command** copies the command text to the clipboard for quick re-use or modification, and **permalink** copies a shareable link to that run's output.

On mobile, the search, history, theme, and FAQ buttons are accessible via the **☰** menu in the top-right corner of the header.

---

## Permalinks

There are two types of permalink:

**Tab snapshot** (`/share/<id>`) — clicking the **permalink** button on any tab captures everything currently visible in that tab (all commands and output) and saves it as a snapshot in SQLite. The resulting URL opens a styled, self-contained HTML page with ANSI colour rendering, a "save .txt" button, a "view json" option, and a link back to the shell. This is the recommended way to share results.

**Single run** (`/history/<run_id>`) — the permalink button in the run history drawer links to an individual run's output, also served as a styled HTML page.

Both types persist across container restarts via the `./data` SQLite volume. The `./data` directory is the only writable path in an otherwise read-only container and is created automatically on first run.

---

## Output Search

Click **⌕ search** in the header to open the search bar above the output. Matches are highlighted in amber; the current match is highlighted brighter. Use **↑↓** buttons or **Enter** / **Shift+Enter** to navigate between matches. Press **Escape** to close.

---

## Dark / Light Theme

Click **◑ theme** in the header to toggle between dark and light mode. Your preference is saved in `localStorage` and persists across sessions.

---

## Database

Run history, tab snapshots, and active process tracking are stored in a SQLite database at `./data/history.db`. The database is created automatically on first run and persists across container restarts and recreations.

### Schema

**`runs` table** — one row per completed command execution:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | TEXT (UUID) | Primary key, used in `/history/<id>` permalink URLs |
| `session_id` | TEXT | Anonymous browser session UUID (from `localStorage`) — scopes history to each user |
| `command` | TEXT | The command as typed by the user |
| `started` | TEXT | ISO 8601 timestamp when the command was submitted |
| `finished` | TEXT | ISO 8601 timestamp when the process exited |
| `exit_code` | INTEGER | Process exit code (0 = success) |
| `output` | TEXT | JSON array of plain-text output lines |

**`snapshots` table** — one row per tab permalink:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | TEXT (UUID) | Primary key, used in `/share/<id>` permalink URLs |
| `session_id` | TEXT | Anonymous browser session UUID |
| `label` | TEXT | Tab label at the time the permalink was created (last command run) |
| `created` | TEXT | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `content` | TEXT | JSON array of `{"text": "...", "cls": "..."}` objects representing every line visible in the tab, including ANSI escape codes for colour reproduction |

**`active_procs` table** — transient table tracking currently running processes:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `run_id` | TEXT (UUID) | Primary key, matches the `run_id` sent to the browser via SSE |
| `pid` | INTEGER | OS process group ID — used by the `/kill` endpoint to send SIGTERM |

This table is cleared on every startup to remove any stale rows left by a previous crash. Rows are inserted when a command starts and deleted when it exits or is killed.

### Retention

The history drawer shows the most recent runs per session up to the `history_panel_limit` config setting, but the database stores everything until pruned. Retention is controlled by `permalink_retention_days` in `config.yaml` — on startup, runs and snapshots older than the configured number of days are deleted. The default is `0` (unlimited). Permalinks will work for as long as the database file exists and the records haven't been pruned.

To inspect or manage the database directly:

```bash
# Row counts
sqlite3 data/history.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM runs; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM snapshots;"

# Check currently running processes
sqlite3 data/history.db "SELECT * FROM active_procs;"

# Delete runs older than 90 days
sqlite3 data/history.db "DELETE FROM runs WHERE started < datetime('now', '-90 days');"

# Delete all snapshots
sqlite3 data/history.db "DELETE FROM snapshots;"
```

---

## Security & Process Isolation

### Users

The container uses two unprivileged system users:

- **`appuser`** — Gunicorn runs as this user. Owns `/data` with `chmod 700`, so it can read and write the SQLite database. Cannot write anywhere else in the read-only container
- **`scanner`** — all user-submitted commands run as this user, enforced by prepending `sudo -u scanner env HOME=/tmp` to every `subprocess.Popen` call. Has no write access to `/data`. `HOME` is explicitly set to `/tmp` (the tmpfs mount) so tools like nuclei that write config and cache to `$HOME` use the in-memory filesystem rather than trying to access a non-existent home directory

As a second layer of defence, the application also blocks any command that references `/data` or `/tmp` as a filesystem path argument at validation time, before the command ever reaches the subprocess layer.

The container starts as root only long enough for `entrypoint.sh` to: fix `/data` ownership after the volume mount resets it, set `/tmp` to `1777` (world-writable with sticky bit), and pre-create `/tmp/.config` and `/tmp/.cache` owned by `scanner` so tools don't try to create them as root. It then drops to `appuser` via `gosu` before starting Gunicorn. Neither `appuser` nor `scanner` has a login shell or password.

### Kill and Cross-User Signalling

Because commands run as `scanner` and Gunicorn runs as `appuser`, `appuser` cannot directly signal `scanner`-owned processes — Linux only allows signalling processes owned by the same user (unless root). The kill endpoint therefore uses `sudo -u scanner kill -TERM -<pgid>` to send SIGTERM to the process group as `scanner`, who owns the processes and has permission to signal them. The `appuser ALL=(scanner) NOPASSWD: ALL` sudoers rule covers this.

### nmap Capabilities

nmap requires raw socket access (`CAP_NET_RAW`, `CAP_NET_ADMIN`) for OS fingerprinting, SYN scans, and other advanced scan types. These are applied directly to the nmap binary via Linux file capabilities:

```
setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip /usr/bin/nmap
```

Any user who executes nmap — including the unprivileged `scanner` user — automatically receives those two capabilities for the duration of the nmap process only. The `--privileged` flag is automatically injected into every nmap command by the app so that nmap uses its full capability set. Users don't need to add it manually.

The `docker-compose.yml` adds `NET_RAW` and `NET_ADMIN` to `cap_add` so the host kernel makes these capabilities available to the container.

### Multi-Worker Kill via SQLite

Gunicorn runs multiple worker processes to handle concurrent requests. This introduces a challenge: if Worker A starts a command and stores its PID, a kill request might be routed to Worker B which has no knowledge of that process.

The naive solution — an in-memory dict — fails because each worker has its own isolated memory space. Python's `multiprocessing.Manager` was tried but proved unreliable after Gunicorn forks workers, with intermittent failures under load due to broken IPC socket connections.

The solution is to use the existing SQLite database as the PID registry via the `active_procs` table. Since SQLite is already shared across all workers for run history, it's a natural fit. Any worker can register a PID on process start, and any other worker can look it up and issue the `sudo kill` on a kill request. SQLite's file-level locking makes concurrent reads and writes safe with no additional synchronisation needed.

---

## Logging

The app logs three structured events per command run using Python's standard `logging` module, written to stdout (captured by Docker's log driver):

| Event | Fields |
|-------|--------|
| `RUN START` | `run_id`, `session_id`, `pid`, `cmd` |
| `RUN END` | `run_id`, `session_id`, `exit`, `elapsed`, `cmd` |
| `RUN KILL` | `run_id`, `pid`, `pgid` |

View live logs with:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose, **or** Python 3.12+ with Flask ≥ 2.0, Gunicorn, PyYAML, and Flask-Limiter
- Linux host (uses `os.setsid` for process group management; `sudo kill` for cross-user process termination)
