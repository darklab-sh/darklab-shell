## Open TODOs

### Validate multi-platform release publication

The dual-platform publication path is implemented. Complete these live checks before shipping the first release that claims native Linux ARM64 support:

- [ ] Qualify anchored staging cleanup in a disposable registry repository.
  - Publish two staging children, create durable architecture anchors, and assemble the canonical index from those anchors, matching the production publication order.
  - Delete only the temporary child and staging-index tags, then confirm the canonical index remains pullable by tag and digest on native AMD64 and ARM64 while both architecture anchors remain intact.
  - Keep successful release child anchors for the lifetime of their release. The separate experiment that removes every child tag and waits for GitLab.com to garbage-collect unreferenced data is useful defense-in-depth evidence, but it does not block a release because production cleanup never deletes those anchors.
  - Leave `RELEASE_STAGING_CLEANUP_ENABLED=0` until the anchored cleanup exercise passes; GitLab.com's later physical storage reclamation does not need to complete before enabling cleanup or publishing the dual-platform release.
- [ ] Complete three consecutive protected release-candidate pipelines in dual mode without manual repair. Each pipeline must build both children natively, pass both smoke and vulnerability lanes, publish one two-platform GitLab index, copy the identical index to Docker Hub, sign the index and both children, and produce matching evidence and payload contracts.
- [ ] On native AMD64 and ARM64 hosts, validate a clean production install, upgrade, status check, backup, restore, bundled-tool verification, and Postgres-backed startup from the same canonical tag. Confirm an unsupported host architecture fails before startup with a clear error.

### Autoscale ARM64 release runners on EC2 Spot

Replace the long-running hosted ARM64 release lane with an ephemeral EC2 worker pool managed by GitLab Runner's Docker Autoscaler and AWS fleeting plugin. Keep the runner manager on existing self-hosted infrastructure, scale the AWS Auto Scaling Group from zero only after the manager accepts a matching job, and destroy each worker after one job. Preserve a documented On-Demand or hosted-runner fallback so Spot capacity does not become a hard release blocker.

- [ ] Define the runner and worker contract before provisioning infrastructure:
  - Use the `docker-autoscaler` executor so the existing Docker job images, service containers, privileged Docker-in-Docker flow, and release scripts keep their current execution model.
  - Give this runner configuration its own AWS Auto Scaling Group; do not share the group with another runner manager or `[[runners]]` entry.
  - Start with one job per instance, one use per instance, one maximum instance, no idle capacity, and no local state that must survive termination.
  - Use an ARM64 worker with at least 8 vCPU, 32 GiB RAM, and a 250 GiB `gp3` Docker volume. Treat `m7g.2xlarge` as the baseline while allowing a configurable pool of compatible Graviton instance types.
- [ ] Add Terraform for the AWS worker pool:
  - Define inputs for AWS region, VPC, worker subnets, runner-manager network ranges, ARM64 AMI, instance-type overrides, maximum capacity, root-volume size and performance, and common resource tags.
  - Create a launch template that requires IMDSv2, uses an ARM64 AMI, enables delete-on-termination storage, and provisions the Docker filesystem on a 250 GiB `gp3` volume with configurable IOPS and throughput.
  - Create a worker security group that allows SSH only from the runner manager's fixed address or private network and allows the outbound DNS, HTTPS, and registry traffic needed by release builds.
  - Create a mixed-instances Auto Scaling Group with minimum and desired capacity `0`, maximum capacity `1` by default, multiple subnets and compatible Graviton instance types, `price-capacity-optimized` Spot allocation, no independent scaling policy, instance scale-in protection, and `AZRebalance` suspended.
  - Keep Spot at 100% for normal operation, but make the purchase policy configurable so an operator can temporarily select On-Demand capacity without changing the runner or CI configuration.
  - Create the least-privilege IAM policy needed by the fleeting manager: describe the ASG and instances, change desired capacity and instance protection, terminate workers through the ASG, inspect Spot requests, and publish temporary SSH keys through EC2 Instance Connect when dynamic credentials are enabled.
  - Output the ASG name, region, worker security-group ID, IAM policy ARN, and other values required by runner-manager configuration without outputting secret credentials.
  - Add Terraform formatting, validation, static security checks, and reviewed plan output. Confirm a second plan is empty after apply and that destroying the stack removes workers, launch-template resources, and disposable volumes cleanly.
- [ ] Prepare a fast, reproducible ARM64 worker image:
  - Bake or otherwise version an ARM64 image with Docker Engine, SSH, EC2 Instance Connect support, CA certificates, and the small set of host utilities required by GitLab's Docker Autoscaler.
  - Enable Docker at boot, grant the connector user access to Docker, and verify `docker info` succeeds over the same SSH path the runner manager uses.
  - Keep boot-time configuration short and deterministic; do not install the full toolchain through user data on every scale-out.
  - Record the image identifier as a Terraform input so worker-image updates produce an intentional launch-template revision.
- [ ] Add generic Ansible management for the existing runner manager:
  - Install or update a GitLab Runner version compatible with GitLab.com and the Docker Autoscaler executor.
  - Configure the AWS fleeting plugin with a pinned compatible version and run `gitlab-runner fleeting install` when the selected plugin version is not already installed.
  - Manage a root-readable AWS config containing the selected profile and region. Store AWS credentials through the automation system's secret mechanism rather than in source control, and keep the credential file readable only by the GitLab Runner service account.
  - Manage the runner's `config.toml` entry with `executor = "docker-autoscaler"`, the protected ARM64 runner tags, privileged Docker support, `capacity_per_instance = 1`, `max_use_count = 1`, `max_instances = 1`, and an all-day policy with `idle_count = 0`.
  - Configure the fleeting plugin with the Terraform-provided ASG name and AWS profile, and configure the SSH connector for either the worker's private address or its public address according to the chosen network design.
  - Persist the runner configuration and, if enabled, taskscaler state across manager restarts with restrictive ownership and permissions.
  - Validate the rendered runner configuration, installed plugin, AWS identity, ASG discovery, and service health before restarting the GitLab Runner service. Keep the Ansible run idempotent.
  - Add runner-manager logging and monitoring for scale requests, worker acquisition time, preparation failures, Spot interruption failures, orphaned instances, and ASG desired capacity that remains above zero without an active job.
- [ ] Prove the network and security boundaries:
  - Confirm the runner manager can reach GitLab.com and the required AWS APIs over HTTPS and can connect to workers over SSH, while workers accept no other inbound application traffic.
  - If workers use public addresses, restrict SSH to a fixed runner-manager source address. If workers use private addresses, document and validate the VPN or routed connection into the VPC.
  - Confirm workers can resolve DNS and reach GitLab registries, Docker Hub, GitHub, language package indexes, and every other source used by the release image build without requiring broad inbound access.
  - Verify the runtime IAM identity cannot modify unrelated Auto Scaling Groups or EC2 instances.
- [ ] Migrate the ARM64 CI lane behind a temporary runner tag:
  - Register the autoscaled runner as protected, locked to the intended project or group scope, and unable to accept untagged jobs.
  - Point a temporary ARM64 build job at the new tag before changing the canonical release jobs.
  - Preserve the current DinD service, MTU handling, native architecture checks, artifact contracts, timeouts, and disk measurements.
  - Add a bounded retry for runner-system failures so a Spot interruption or failed worker acquisition can retry an idempotent build without hiding repeatable product failures.
  - Keep the current ARM64 runner path available until the EC2 lane passes qualification and the fallback procedure has been exercised.
- [ ] Qualify performance, cleanup, failure handling, and cost:
  - Demonstrate scale from desired capacity `0` to `1` after job acceptance and back to `0` after completion, with no worker or EBS volume left behind.
  - Run an uncached release image build and record provisioning time, build and export duration, peak disk use, final free-space percentage, CPU and memory pressure, and total Spot runtime.
  - Run consecutive cached builds through the registry cache and confirm the larger worker avoids the cache-import and export-time disk exhaustion seen on the hosted ARM64 lane.
  - Require at least 20% free Docker storage after image export and enough wall-clock margin to stay comfortably within the CI job timeout.
  - Trigger a controlled Spot interruption, confirm the interrupted job fails as a runner-system failure, and confirm its retry starts on a fresh instance without conflicting with staging tags or publication state.
  - Exercise the On-Demand fallback and return the ASG to Spot afterward.
  - Add an AWS budget or cost alarm and confirm the idle-state cost is limited to the always-on runner manager and any intentionally retained supporting infrastructure.
- [ ] Cut over only after three consecutive ARM64 release rehearsals complete without manual repair. Then update the maintained CI and contributor documentation, remove the obsolete runner path, and record the final instance pool, storage floor, fallback policy, and measured build timings in `DECISIONS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Feature Enhancements

These are possible future improvements, split by whether they look worth carrying forward.

- **Webhook receiver / `POST /api/v1/intel/<provider>` passthrough.**
  - Worth scoping once outbound notifications and external automation mature. The headless API is the right place to receive webhooks that auto-create or update projects.
- **Cross-session Atlas view.**
  - Useful for operators managing multiple sessions or shared infrastructure, especially now that team mode makes shared context more important.
- **Extend comparison beyond run-to-run finding and artifact diffs.**
  - Snapshot and package-artifact comparisons are likely useful once evidence packages become a regular handoff surface.
- **Package re-import preview/apply.**
  - Worth scoping once package handoff archives are used regularly. It should reuse the Atlas import preview/apply pattern and the package manifest import hints before it writes project data.
- **Project Monitoring CLI surface.**
  - Possible future `darklab monitoring <project_id>` and `darklab monitoring ack <project_id> <fire_id> --state STATE [--note NOTE]` commands could expose the Project Monitoring dashboard, rollups, and fire triage flow without opening the browser.
  - Keep this lower priority than watcher creation, Project assignment, policy controls, and baseline acceptance, which are already available through `darklab watch`.
- **Headless API and CLI follow-through.**
  - Let scripts and CI start, inspect, cancel, and follow durable workflows through token-authenticated API routes and matching `darklab workflow` commands. Expose saved-run comparison through the same headless surface once its permission, team-scope, and bounded-output contracts are defined.
  - Put the workflow execution event cursor to work for browser refresh or headless replay, or retire it if execution polling remains the supported path.
  - Add `darklab --version` for the installed client. Treat connected-server version and client/server compatibility reporting as a separate decision.
  - Bring the existing API v1 AI assists to the CLI with summary and next-command commands that handle cached, queued, in-progress, disabled, and failed states cleanly.
- **Revisit PTY transport after real usage.**
  - The current Redis-brokered SSE plus POST endpoints keep deployment simple, but WebSockets may be worth it if latency, throughput, or bidirectional control becomes a real limitation.
- **Split `pty.js` and `pty_service.py` if PTY work grows again.**
  - Worth doing when new PTY behavior lands; orchestration, modal wiring, xterm session handling, lifecycle, transport, and metadata storage are natural boundaries.
- **Introduce a small PTY host interface object and broader PTY browser coverage.**
  - Would make PTY tests less brittle and keep future tab-state or disabled-terminal changes from drifting.
- **Reduce idle PTY control-channel work if concurrency becomes real.**
  - Redis Pub/Sub, a longer block window, or avoiding unnecessary attach-time snapshot writes would be worthwhile if many PTYs are active at once.

## Research

No research items are currently tracked.

## Ideas

These are product ideas and possible enhancements, not committed TODOs or planned work.

### Run replay / scrubbable event stream
- Turn completed runs into replayable structured event logs, building on the Structured Output Model.
- Support a scrub timeline, bookmarks, per-line comments, and command-by-command playback.
- Keep replay integrated with findings, Atlas entities, summaries, and run comparison rather than treating it as a separate asciinema-style recording.

### Run comparison enhancements — deferred pieces
- Run comparison now covers finding severity changes, discovered hosts, TLS fields, workflow context, and completed-tab launch points. The remaining ideas are:
  - Snapshot/permalink compare, once the compare route can resolve snapshot/permalink ids instead of only live `runs` rows.
  - `Export comparison`, once share/export packages have one unified, stable artifact schema version rather than several independent `schema_version` fields.
  - Unifying the comparison-local URL/status/title parsing (`httpx`/`ffuf`/`gobuster`/`katana`) with the shared tool-aware classifier registry that ports/hosts/tls already use.
  - Date-range filters in the manual compare picker, if day grouping plus `Load More` is not enough for deep history.
  - Broader Playwright coverage for additional edge and mobile layout paths.
  - Focused large/noisy comparison regression coverage if real-world outputs expose performance issues beyond current backend and unit coverage.

### Bulk history export and share
- The history drawer can delete all, delete non-favorites, export selected history as text/JSONL, and use visible-page multi-select for bulk project add/remove plus selected-item delete. Bulk share/permalink bundles would close the remaining gap when packaging selected history items after an engagement.

### Mobile share ergonomics
- The native share-sheet for permalink URLs is done (v1.5, `navigator.share()` with clipboard fallback). What remains is making the broader mobile save/share experience feel intentional:
  - save/share actions tuned for one-handed use
  - clearer copy/share/export affordances inside the mobile shell
  - better share handoff after snapshot creation

### PWA install and service-worker push
- Make the mobile shell installable and deliver completion pings via web-push so phone users get notified when the tab is closed or the device is asleep. Today mobile notifications are intentionally hidden because foreground-only notifications are not useful on phones.
- Reuse the run-complete notification hook so push delivery becomes another channel rather than a separate completion system.
- **Entry-level scope:**
  - Add a manifest, app icons, and a small service worker so users can "Add to Home Screen" and launch into a standalone mobile shell.
  - VAPID-signed web-push subscription tied to the active session token; subscribe and unsubscribe from the Options sheet.
- **Architecture:**
  - New `app/static/manifest.webmanifest`, icon assets under `app/static/icons/`, and `app/static/sw.js` registered from `app.js` only when the runtime supports it.
  - New `WebPushChannel` in the notifications service; VAPID keys stored as operator config; per-session-token subscription endpoint at `/session/push/subscribe`.
  - Service worker scope is intentionally narrow — render notifications and open the tab on click; no caching of dynamic transcript content so users never see stale output.
  - Gotchas: iOS Safari requires the user to install the PWA before push works; document this in CONFIGURATION.md.

### Engagement report builder
- The Project Report tab now covers the base narrative-report flow. Future polish can make reports feel more portable and customer-ready:
  - Add report-created run links or permalinks where needed, carrying the report's redaction mode and showing the `permalink_retention_days` caveat in preview/export metadata.
  - Feed richer package/export provenance into the report once that plan lands, especially source run/import context and target relationships.
  - Tune artifact embedding/listing once provenance and report-created run links are available; screenshot galleries and richer binary handling can stay later work.
  - Run a browser Print/PDF fidelity pass across Chrome, Safari, and Firefox for page breaks, headers/footers, and fonts. If the browser print path cannot produce a consistent customer-grade PDF, revisit a server-side PDF renderer with its Docker/dependency cost documented.
  - Consider saved report versions, richer in-UI template customization, arbitrary custom sections, approvals, and shareable report permalinks after the one-current-draft workflow has real usage.

### Native ticketing integrations
- From the Findings tab, Project views, or evidence package flows, create or update issues in Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, GitLab, etc., with bidirectional sync of status, notes, and links back into the finding review state.
- Keep the action close to existing triage and review-state controls so tickets feel like an extension of finding review, not a separate export step.
- **Entry-level scope:**
  - Generic webhook + templated payload connector plus first-class adapters for the most common trackers.
  - Secret-backed auth stored in the existing encrypted secrets surface.
  - One-click "Create ticket" and "Link existing" actions on individual findings and bulk on visible-page selections.
  - Map finding review state to ticket status (and vice versa) where the tracker supports webhooks or polling.
- **Architecture:**
  - New `app/services/integrations/ticketing/` package (or a lighter `notifications` extension).
  - Adds project-level and global configuration surfaces under Options or a new Integrations tab.
  - Preserves the existing outbound notification model for fire-and-forget alerts while adding the stateful sync path.

### Operator-extensible signal and parser rules
- Allow operators to extend the built-in findings classifier, entity extractor, and structured metadata logic via a hot-reloadable `conf/signals.yaml` (or small sandboxed snippets) without code changes.
- Custom rules feed the same findings strip, Atlas materialization, search scopes, run comparison diffs, project triage, and export surfaces as core signals.
- Target custom scanner output and internal tooling first; the biggest value is letting self-hosted teams teach darklab_shell their local signal language without carrying a fork.
- **Entry-level scope:**
  - Declarative regex + capture group + mapping rules for common cases (e.g., custom internal scanner output).
  - Optional tiny expression or Lua/JS sandbox for complex parsing.
  - Live reload on file change (consistent with `commands.yaml`, `workflows.yaml`, etc.).
- **Architecture:**
  - Extend or parallel `app/core/output_signals.py` with a user-rules loader.
  - Surface validation and a `/diag` inspector mode for testing new rules against recent output samples.

## Architecture

### Unified terminal built-in lifecycle
- Browser-owned built-ins (`theme`, `config`, and `session-token`) need browser execution for DOM state, local storage, clipboard, and transcript-owned confirmations, while server-owned built-ins naturally flow through `/runs`.
- The long-term cleanup target is one terminal-command lifecycle after execution:
  - normalize built-in output into a shared result shape
  - apply pipe helpers against that shape
  - mask sensitive command arguments once
  - render transcript output once
  - persist server-backed history once
  - load recents and prompt history from the same saved run model
- Keep execution ownership separate where it matters, but remove duplicated recents/history/pipe/persistence glue so browser-owned and server-owned built-ins cannot drift.

### Plugin-style helper command registry
- Turn the built-in command layer into a cleaner extension point for future app-native helpers.

### Lightweight Jinja base template
- `index.html`, `permalink_base.html`, and `diag.html` now all share the same ~10 lines of `<head>` bootstrap (charset, viewport, color-scheme meta, favicon, `fonts.css`, `styles.css`, theme var includes, and the two vendor scripts). With three templates the duplication is starting to pay for the indirection.
- A `base.html` factoring out the common `<head>` and `data-theme` body attribute would prevent drift and make adding a fourth page type trivial.

### Interactive PTY transport future-state
- Revisit whether the current Redis-brokered SSE plus POST input/resize transport should move to WebSockets after real use.
- The current model keeps deployment simple and avoids a WebSocket runtime, but a bidirectional socket could reduce input latency and simplify the modal terminal stream once PTY usage grows.
