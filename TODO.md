## Open TODOs

- **Light theme polish and shared theme-token expansion**
  - The current light themes are usable, but several of them still flatten important surfaces together:
    - page background, panels, terminal surface, terminal title bar, history drawer, and destructive modal surfaces are too close in value
    - borders and wrap shadows are too low-contrast on pale backgrounds
    - muted text is marginal on some warm themes
    - the welcome ASCII treatment on light themes tends to look washed out instead of intentional
  - The right scope is token-level theme work, not component rewrites. The goal is to improve the visual hierarchy of the existing UI while keeping the current layout and interaction model intact.
  - This work also needs a small theme-system expansion so the UI can style a few surfaces independently instead of reusing nearby tokens that were “close enough” for the dark themes:
    - add theme support for a dedicated status-strip background, border, and text color
    - add a soft-border token for subtle separators that should sit between `border` and `border_bright`
    - add an explicit welcome-ASCII color token so the welcome mark can diverge from the generic success green where that improves the theme identity
  - Repo touch points:
    - [app/config.py](app/config.py)
      - add the new theme keys to the default theme families
      - add the keys to `_THEME_CSS_ORDER`
      - ensure `theme_runtime_css_vars()` emits them for the browser, permalinks, and exports
    - [app/static/css/base.css](app/static/css/base.css)
      - declare the new `--theme-*` variables in `:root`
    - [app/static/css/shell.css](app/static/css/shell.css) or the actual current status-strip rule location
      - move the status strip off `panel_alt_bg` / `panel_border` / `muted`
      - use the new status-strip tokens instead
    - [app/static/css/welcome.css](app/static/css/welcome.css)
      - allow the welcome ASCII block to use a dedicated theme token instead of always inheriting `--green`
    - [app/conf/themes/*.yaml](app/conf/themes/)
      - update all light themes with the revised hierarchy, accent, muted-text, and welcome-filter values
      - add the new keys to dark themes too so the theme export path stays uniform across all theme files
  - Design direction for the light-theme pass:
    - widen the separation between `bg`, `panel_bg`, `surface`, `terminal_bar_bg`, `history_panel_bg`, and `confirm_modal_bg`
    - deepen border / shadow tokens enough that panel edges remain visible at normal zoom
    - darken muted text where needed to keep it safely readable on pale backgrounds
    - make light-theme welcome ASCII feel deliberate rather than desaturated
    - preserve each theme’s identity rather than collapsing them into one generic “good light theme”
  - Important implementation rule:
    - do the token plumbing first, then theme YAML changes
    - verify the dark themes still look unchanged before accepting the light-theme visual diffs
  - Validation should be capture-driven, not just eyeballed in one tab:
    - regenerate light-theme screenshot captures and review them against the known desktop/mobile capture scenes
    - run a dark-theme regression check on at least:
      - main shell idle
      - welcome completed
      - history drawer open
      - options modal
      - destructive confirmation modal
    - verify the new tokens reach:
      - main UI
      - permalink pages
      - HTML export surfaces
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - light themes show clearer surface separation without losing their individual character
    - the terminal wrap border and drawer/modal edges remain visible on light backgrounds
    - muted text remains readable across the set
    - the status strip reads as its own surface instead of blending into adjacent panels
    - welcome ASCII color/filter treatment looks intentional on light themes
    - dark themes show no unintended regressions after the shared token changes

### Priority order

Ranked by user benefit weighted against implementation complexity. Benefit and complexity use a three-point scale (H / M / L). Items marked ⬡ are foundational — they unlock multiple later features and should be designed before the features that depend on them are built.

**Tier 1 — Quick wins (high benefit, low complexity)**

| Idea | Benefit | Complexity | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| Better output navigation | H | L | Line classes already exist; only navigation logic needed |
| Run labels from terminal | M | L | Fake command + DB column + history drawer display |
| Richer run metadata in history UI | M | L | Data already stored; surfacing only |

**Tier 2 — High value, moderate effort**

| Idea | Benefit | Complexity | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| Command outcome summaries | H | M | Start narrow (nmap, dig, curl, openssl); highest signal-to-noise value of any feature on the list |
| Additional export formats | M | L–M | JSONL is straightforward; Markdown needs formatting logic |
| Bulk history operations | M | L–M | Checkbox mode in history drawer + bulk endpoints |
| Share package | H | M | Unified design reduces total work vs building annotations, notes, and lifecycle separately |
| Mobile share ergonomics | M | L–M | Basic native share-sheet done (v1.5); remaining work is one-handed save/share UX and clearer affordances |
| Tool-specific guidance + onboarding hints | M | L | Primarily content work |
| Session dashboards (`stats` command) | M | L | Fake command + queries that already exist for the diagnostics page |

**Tier 3 — Foundational ⬡ (unlock multiple later features)**

| Idea | Benefit | Complexity | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| Structured command catalog ⬡ | H | H | Unblocks parameterized forms, improved autocomplete, and policy metadata; design forms against this before building them |
| Structured output model ⬡ | H | H | Unblocks command summaries, run comparison, and richer exports; build summaries to be retro-fittable once this is in place |

**Tier 4 — Moderate value, moderate effort**

| Idea | Benefit | Complexity | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| History bookmarks beyond stars | M | M | Schema change + label management UI; complements run labels from terminal |
| Saved command presets | M | M | New DB table + preset management UI |
| Workflow replay and promotion | M | M–H | Promotion from history is the core feature; YAML parameterization is secondary |
| Run comparison | M | H | Diff algorithm + run-selection UI; more compelling once history filtering is stronger |
| Per-command policy metadata | M | M | Allowlist format extension + hint surfaces |
| Richer audit trail | L–M | L | Logging additions only |
| Autocomplete from output context | L–M | M | Narrow use case; useful but not on the critical path |

**Tier 5 — Major initiatives (high benefit, high complexity)**

| Idea | Benefit | Complexity | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| Ephemeral per-session workspace | H | H | Needs allowlist workspace mode, quota, cleanup, and isolation model — not just tmpfs allocation |
| Parameterized command forms | M | H | Depends on structured command catalog; do not build independently |
| Run collections / case folders | M | H | New data model + grouping UI |
| Snapshot diff against current tab | M | H | Builds on run comparison; defer until comparison is done |

**Tier 6 — Defer (high complexity relative to incremental value)**

| Idea | Benefit | Complexity | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| Full reconnectable live stream | M | H | Separate architecture pass; do not conflate with incremental UI polish |
| Environment capability hints | L–M | M | Pre-run hints have lower per-use value than post-run summaries |
| Interactive PTY mode | M | H | Full PTY + WebSocket architecture for a small allowlisted set |
| Plugin-style helper command registry | L | M | Internal quality; revisit when fake-command layer needs more structure |

### Near-term

- **Workflow inputs and runnable forms**
  - Let workflows declare required inputs so the user can fill in the needed values and launch the full workflow directly from the UI instead of treating workflows as static reference text.
  - The first version should stay narrowly scoped:
    - declare required values in the workflow definition
    - collect them in a lightweight app-native form
    - render the final command sequence clearly before execution
  - This should build on the existing workflows system rather than becoming a second parallel command-form feature.

- **Share package** (annotations, notes, and lifecycle controls)
  - Snapshots currently have no metadata beyond the raw output. Add optional title, note, and tags as a unified share package rather than building annotations, operator notes, and sharing controls as disconnected features — they compose into one coherent model.
  - Share package surface:
    - operator-facing title and note on the snapshot
    - tags
    - optional operator / team label
    - redaction mode used
    - a small generated summary block for the shared run
    - private notes attached to history entries (visible locally, never in public snapshots)
  - Share lifecycle controls:
    - expiring share links
    - one-time reveal links for sensitive snapshot sharing
  - Design all three (annotations, notes, lifecycle) together so the data model is consistent from the start.

- **Additional export formats**
  - Add Markdown and JSONL export in addition to `.txt` and themed `.html`.
  - Pairs naturally with the existing export system and structured output work.
  - Make structured exports first-class:
    - include command, timestamps, exit code, line classes, and preview/full-output metadata
    - treat `JSONL` as a real machine-readable export, not just another text dump

- **Better output navigation**
  - For security tool output, 90% of lines are noise and 10% are findings. The most valuable part of this idea is jump-between-errors/warnings, not jump-to-top/bottom.
  - Primary value:
    - jump between warnings / errors / notices (uses existing line classes; this is the core feature)
    - highlight matched lines from search more aggressively
  - Secondary, lower cost:
    - sticky command header for long runs (near-free CSS position: sticky change)
  - Deferred until primary is done:
    - collapse long low-signal sections (genuinely complex, lower incremental value)

- **Run comparison**
  - Compare two runs side by side, especially for repeated scans or before/after checks.
  - More compelling once history filtering is stronger.
  - Focus the first version on repeated commands:
    - compare two runs of the same command
    - show added / removed lines
    - surface exit-code and elapsed-time changes
    - allow a "differences only" view
  - The diff target should explicitly include permalinks and snapshots (not just history entries) — the most common real-world case is comparing a new scan against last month's saved permalink, not two history rows in the same session.

- **Tool-specific guidance**
  - Add lightweight inline notes for tools with non-obvious web-shell behavior like `mtr`, `nmap`, `wapiti`, or `nuclei`.
  - Good fit for the existing help / FAQ / welcome surfaces.
  - Merge this with onboarding and command hints into a broader operator-guidance layer:
    - command-specific caveats
    - runtime expectations
    - examples of when to use one tool vs another

- **Richer run metadata in the history UI**
  - Surface preview/full-output availability, retention expectations, and share/export readiness more clearly.
  - Good fit for the existing history drawer and permalink model.
  - Include retention-aware UX:
    - "preview only" vs "full output available"
    - share readiness
    - export readiness
    - expiry / retention timing

- **Command outcome summaries**
  - For selected tools, generate short app-native summaries above the raw output. Security tool output is high-volume; a structured findings layer is what separates a purpose-built tool from a raw terminal.
  - Keep raw output primary — the summary is additive, never a replacement.
  - Start narrow: nmap (open ports + service table), dig (records returned), curl (status code + redirect chain), openssl s_client (cert expiry + trust chain).
  - The structured output model (see Architecture) is the right long-term foundation; build this feature to be retro-fittable once that model is in place rather than requiring it up front.

- **Capture pack review manifest**
  - Generate a simple HTML or Markdown index alongside screenshot packs so designers, themers, and reviewers can browse labeled scenes quickly without opening dozens of PNGs by hand.
  - Include theme, viewport, and scene labels in one place so capture packs are easier to share and audit.

### Later

- **Saved command presets**
  - Let users save named command templates beyond history/starred entries.
  - Better for repeat workflows like DNS checks, HTTP triage, or common scan recipes.
  - Converge this with structured forms:
    - reusable saved workflows
    - optional structured parameters
    - always editable back to raw shell text

- **Parameterized command forms**
  - Add optional structured builders for common tools like `curl`, `dig`, `nmap`, and `ffuf`.
  - Keep raw-shell usage intact while making common tasks easier.
  - Build these on top of a reusable command/workflow preset model rather than as a disconnected UI feature.
  - The autocomplete YAML already models command structure (`flags`, `expects_value`, `arg_hints`, `__positional__`). Forms should be a structured render of that same data — not a parallel model — so the two features stay consistent and share maintenance. Design against the structured command catalog (see Architecture) before building.

- **Session dashboards**
  - Add a compact session summary view. The lowest-complexity version of this is a `session` or `stats` built-in command rather than a dedicated page — it fits the shell-primary interaction model and reuses the existing fake-command layer.
  - Built-in command output:
    - command breakdown by tool root
    - success/fail rates and average scan durations
    - starred artifact count
    - active session token status
  - Natural fit with history, diagnostics, and session tokens.

- **Run collections / case folders**
  - Let users group related runs and snapshots into named investigations or cases.
  - Better long-term organization than tabs/history alone.

- **History bookmarks beyond stars**
  - Add richer saved-state labels like `important`, `baseline`, `follow-up`, or `customer-facing`.
  - Stronger foundation for compare/share/history workflows than a single star state.

- **Snapshot diff against current tab**
  - Compare the live tab against a previous run or snapshot without leaving the shell flow.

- **Workflow replay and promotion**
  - Guided workflows are currently stateless prompt-fillers — you cannot save a customized version of a built-in workflow, and there is no way to replay a sequence you discovered through normal use.
  - The compelling feature is "promote this run sequence to a workflow": select 3–5 history entries and save them as a named reusable sequence. That is more useful than just parameterizing the existing YAML format.
  - Turn guided workflows into reusable multi-step sequences that can be replayed, edited, and saved.

- **Additional built-in workflow candidates**
  - Candidate workflow cards that still complement the current guided workflows panel:
  - **WAF Detection** — wafw00f to identify the WAF vendor, curl with unexpected headers/paths to observe the blocking behavior, nmap WAF NSE scripts for a second opinion.
  - **WordPress Audit** — wpscan for known plugin/theme CVEs and user enumeration, curl to confirm common WP paths and the XML-RPC endpoint.
  - **DNS Delegation Diff** — host/nslookup for quick answers, dig @authoritative vs @public-resolver for disagreement checks, dig +trace to walk the delegation chain. More focused than the existing DNS card when the problem is split-brain or propagation lag.
  - **Hostname / Virtual Host Discovery** — gobuster vhost or ffuf Host-header fuzzing to identify name-based virtual hosts, then curl -H 'Host: ...' to validate which ones actually answer. Useful when an IP serves multiple sites and plain HTTP triage is too shallow.
  - **Surface Crawl to Endpoint Follow-up** — katana to crawl reachable URLs, pd-httpx or curl -I to classify what came back, then targeted curl checks against the interesting endpoints. Good middle ground between HTTP triage and heavier vuln scanning.
  - **Screenshot / Tech Fingerprint Sweep** — pd-httpx with title/tech-detect/status probes to quickly map many hosts, then curl on the standouts. Strong fit for the modal because it helps operators decide where to spend deeper scanning budget next.
  - **Certificate Inventory Across Hosts** — subfinder or assetfinder to build a host set, dnsx to keep only resolvable names, then openssl s_client or testssl against the likely HTTPS services. More operationally useful than a single-host TLS check when reviewing a whole domain footprint.
  - **Resolver Reputation / Mail Deliverability Baseline** — dig MX/TXT, nslookup against multiple resolvers, and whois on the sending domain or mail host. Distinct from the existing email card because it aims at “will this domain look sane to remote receivers?” rather than just “is SMTP open?”
  - **Crawlable Web App Triage** — curl -sIL for redirect/header shape, katana for path discovery, nikto for quick misconfig findings. A better default web-app sequence than running nikto cold against an unknown target.
  - **Service Exposure Drift** — repeatable baseline using nmap -F, nc -zv on expected ports, and curl or openssl s_client on the important services. This is less about discovery and more about quickly validating that a host still looks like the last known-good state.
  - Prefer workflow cards that chain 3-4 commands with a clear operator decision at each step; avoid modal entries that are just “run one big scanner.”
  - Prefer sequences that mix cheap classification first and heavier scanning second so the modal remains useful on mobile and in constrained environments.

- **Environment capability hints**
  - Surface when a tool is likely to be slow, noisy, truncated, or constrained by the container/runtime before it runs.

- **Run labels from the terminal**
  - A `tag <label>` built-in command that attaches a label to the most recent completed run directly from the shell flow, without opening the history drawer.
  - Labels like `baseline`, `finding`, `follow-up`, `customer-facing` are more precise than a binary star and set up richer compare/share/history workflows.
  - Complements "History bookmarks beyond stars" — the terminal command is the primary way to label, the history drawer is where labels are visible and filterable.

- **Bulk history operations**
  - The history drawer can delete all or delete non-favorites. Adding multi-select (checkbox mode) with bulk delete, bulk export to JSONL/txt, and bulk share would close a real gap when clearing out a session after an engagement or exporting selected findings.

- **Autocomplete suggestions from output context**
  - When a previous command's output is in the active tab, `| grep` completions could suggest patterns already present in that output — IP addresses, hostnames, status codes, CVE strings — as candidates alongside the generic flag list.
  - Narrow but would make the pipe stage feel predictive rather than generic.

### Mobile

- **Mobile share ergonomics**
  - The native share-sheet for permalink URLs is done (v1.5, `navigator.share()` with clipboard fallback). What remains is making the broader mobile save/share experience feel intentional:
    - save/share actions tuned for one-handed use
    - clearer copy/share/export affordances inside the mobile shell
    - better share handoff after snapshot creation

### Safety and Policy

- **Richer audit trail**
  - Optional logging around share creation, deletions, and run access patterns.

- **Per-command policy metadata**
  - Allowlist entries could carry metadata like `risky`, `slow`, `high-output`, or `full-output recommended`.
  - The UI could surface this in help, warnings, or command builders.

### Content and Guidance

- **Tool-tips and onboarding hints**
  - Extend the welcome flow and help surfaces so onboarding suggests real tasks and tool combinations, not just isolated commands and hints.
  - Fold this together with tool-specific guidance:
    - "what to run next" suggestions
    - common operator playbooks
    - guidance tied to workflows, autocomplete, and command metadata

### Architecture

- **Full reconnectable live stream**
  - Explore a true reconnectable live-output path that can resume active command streams after reload rather than only restoring a placeholder tab and polling for completion.
  - This is a separate architecture step from the current active-run reconnect support and would likely require:
    - a per-run live output buffer
    - resumable stream offsets or event IDs
    - multi-consumer fan-out instead of one transient SSE consumer
    - explicit lifecycle cleanup once runs complete
  - Best fit is a dedicated live-stream architecture pass rather than incremental UI polish.

- **Structured command catalog**
  - Move from plain-text allowlist-only metadata toward a richer command catalog model.
  - This would unlock better autocomplete, command forms, grouped help, and policy hints.
  - Design parameterized command forms (see Later) against this catalog model before building them — both features need the same structured command data and will diverge if built independently.

- **Structured output model**
  - Preserve richer line/event metadata consistently for all runs.
  - This would improve search, comparison, redaction, exports, and permalink fidelity.
  - Command outcome summaries (see Near-term) are buildable without this foundation, but design them to be retro-fittable once the structured model is in place — the summary parsers should consume structured line events, not re-parse raw text.

- **Unified terminal built-in lifecycle**
  - Browser-owned built-ins (`theme`, `config`, and `session-token`) need browser execution for DOM state, local storage, clipboard, and transcript-owned confirmations, while server-owned built-ins naturally flow through `/run`.
  - The long-term cleanup target is one terminal-command lifecycle after execution:
    - normalize built-in output into a shared result shape
    - apply pipe helpers against that shape
    - mask sensitive command arguments once
    - render transcript output once
    - persist server-backed history once
    - hydrate recents and prompt history from the same saved run model
  - Keep execution ownership separate where it matters, but remove duplicated recents/history/pipe/persistence glue so browser-owned and server-owned built-ins cannot drift.

- **Plugin-style helper command registry**
  - Turn the fake-command layer into a cleaner extension surface for future app-native helpers.

- **Ephemeral per-session workspace mode**
  - Add an optional tmpfs-backed per-session working directory so users can create short-lived files and use more natural shell workflows such as `ls`, `cat`, `rm`, and output redirection into files.
  - Treat this as a separate execution mode with its own validation, cleanup, quota, and audit model rather than as a small shell-ergonomics enhancement.
  - The existing allowed_commands system would need a paired workspace mode — `ls`, `cat`, `rm`, `mv`, and output redirection (`>`, `>>`) are either blocked metacharacters or not in the allowlist today. A workspace mode needs explicit allowlist support, not just a tmpfs allocation.
  - Scope the safety model explicitly:
    - per-session byte quota
    - max file size
    - max file count / inode-style limit
    - aggressive cleanup on expiry
    - optional app-mediated file download support from the active session workspace
  - Consider a stronger isolation path as a later phase:
    - a real per-session chroot-style jail or equivalent container-level filesystem jail so the shell process cannot see outside the session workspace at all
    - this would make the feature feel much more like a real shell while reducing accidental filesystem exposure

- **Lightweight Jinja base template**
  - `index.html`, `permalink_base.html`, and `diag.html` now all share the same ~10 lines of `<head>` bootstrap (charset, viewport, color-scheme meta, favicon, `fonts.css`, `styles.css`, theme var includes, and the two vendor scripts). With three templates the duplication is starting to pay for the indirection.
  - A `base.html` factoring out the common `<head>` and `data-theme` body attribute would prevent drift and make adding a fourth page type trivial.

- **Interactive PTY mode for screen-based tools**
  - Explore an optional PTY + WebSocket + browser terminal emulator path for a small allowlisted set of interactive or screen-redrawing tools such as `mtr`, without turning the app into a general-purpose remote shell.
  - Best fit is a separate interactive-command mode or tab type, not a full browser shell session.
  - This would be a larger architecture change because it needs:
    - server-side PTY management
    - bidirectional browser transport
    - terminal resize handling
    - stricter command scoping and lifecycle cleanup
