## Open TODOs

- **Potential interactive PTY improvements**
  - **Current state:** `mtr --interactive <host>`, `ffuf --interactive ...`, and `masscan --interactive ...` have a guarded PTY path behind `interactive_pty_enabled`, use dedicated `/pty/runs` start/stream/input/resize routes, broker PTY events through Redis in multi-worker deployments, support multiple concurrent PTY runs per session with each live terminal scoped to its owning tab, render the live terminal in an xterm.js modal, and append completed PTY runs back into the normal terminal/history output path using server-side terminal capture.
  - **Lifecycle and resilience**
    - Add lifecycle cleanup beyond process exit and max runtime, including stale closed-run cleanup and clearer browser-disconnect behavior.
    - Treat worker-death mid-run as a known limitation: the server-side terminal screen lives on the worker that owns `master_fd`, so a worker crash before exit drops the run from history. Periodic terminal-state snapshots into Redis would address this and are deferred until real usage shows they are needed.
    - Revisit transport after real usage: the current pass uses Redis-brokered SSE plus narrow POST input/resize endpoints to avoid adding a WebSocket server dependency; WebSocket may still be useful if latency or throughput becomes a problem.
  - **Security**
    - Interactive input is a broader policy surface than normal command validation because keystrokes after process start are not re-validated. Keep the first-pass allowlist narrow and require future PTY tools to declare an explicit input-safety profile before enabling tools with shell escapes, external command prompts, file pickers, or embedded interpreters.
    - Defer asciinema-style raw byte replay and input auditing until real usage shows they are needed.
  - **UX and output shaping**
    - Completed PTY transcript rendering is currently one-size-fits-all. The parent transcript appends the final frame, which is ideal for `mtr` but can omit useful scrolled findings from `ffuf`/`masscan` or include noisy status redraws depending on the tool. Add a registry-owned transcript mode later, such as `final_frame`, `scrollback_findings`, or `all_sanitized`, once real sessions show which tools need custom output shaping.
  - **Architecture**
    - `pty.js` is 725 lines and growing. Split into `pty.js` (orchestration, command detection, entry point), `pty_modal.js` (modal HTML wiring, timer, status), and `pty_terminal.js` (xterm session, resize handlers).
    - `pty_service.py` is ~840 lines mixing terminal capture, run lifecycle, Redis stream transport, control-stream draining, and meta storage. Capture and transport are natural module boundaries; splitting them keeps the lifecycle file readable.
    - The Vitest finalize test mocks 14 globals to exercise pty.js. Introduce a small PTY host interface object that pty.js receives at init and the tests inject a fake for, so the runner.js global surface stops bleeding into PTY tests.
    - Add browser unit coverage for PTY tab state transitions and disabled normal-terminal behaviors.
  - **Polish and operational**
    - `_PTY_INPUT_MAX_BYTES`, `_PTY_BUFFER_LIMIT`, `_PTY_CONTROL_POLL_SECONDS`, and similar tunables are module constants. Move to config so deploys can tune without a rebuild.
    - Add metrics covering concurrent PTY count, average and p95 duration, total input bytes, dropped input bytes, and control queue depth. Expose them through the existing `/diag` surface so operators have visibility comparable to other run paths.
    - The reader loop polls Redis every 200 ms via `xread block=1` for control events. With many concurrent PTYs this is wasted ops. Switch the control channel to Redis Pub/Sub (or a longer block window) so idle PTYs cost zero ops while output latency stays unaffected.

## Ideas

These are product ideas and possible enhancements, not committed TODOs or planned work.

- **Tool-specific guidance**
  - Add lightweight inline notes for tools with non-obvious web-shell behavior like `mtr`, `nmap`, `naabu`, or `nuclei`.
  - Good fit for the existing help / FAQ / welcome surfaces.
  - Merge this with onboarding and command hints into a broader user guidance layer:
    - command-specific caveats
    - what to expect while a tool runs
    - examples of when to use one tool vs another

- **Command catalog future-state**
  - Add `commands search <term>` for roots, descriptions, categories, examples, and flag text.
  - Add `commands --json` or `commands info --json <root>` for debugging, export, and future UI reuse.
  - Add optional richer registry fields such as `details`, `notes`, `common_flags`, or `gotchas` when a flag or tool needs more than a short autocomplete description.
  - Add command-specific guidance for web-shell behavior, including injected safe defaults, quiet-running tools, generated Files output, and managed session state.
  - Add autocomplete side previews later: when a root, subcommand, or flag is highlighted, show the command description or flag note in a small help pane.
  - Add hover/focus cards for FAQ chips once the command-details modal behavior has settled.
  - Consider including pipe helpers in a separate “Pipes” section once command catalog UX exists.
  - Consider linking command catalog entries to real `man` output where available, while keeping app-native allowed-subset details primary.

- **Command outcome summaries**
  - For selected tools, generate short app-native summaries below the raw output. Security tool output is high-volume; a clear findings layer is what separates a purpose-built tool from a raw terminal.
  - Keep raw output primary — the summary is additive, never a replacement.
  - Start narrow: nmap (open ports + service table), dig (records returned), curl (status code + redirect chain), openssl s_client (cert expiry + trust chain).
  - The structured output model (see Architecture) is the right long-term foundation. Build this feature so it can move onto that model later instead of requiring it up front.

- **Transcript noise classification**
  - Future cleanup for saved command output across both normal runs and interactive PTY runs.
  - Avoid broad duplicate-line removal because repeated lines can be meaningful findings for some tools.
  - Classify known progress/status/redraw lines before history/search/finding classification, starting with high-noise shapes from tools like `masscan`, `ffuf`, `nuclei`, and ProjectDiscovery tools that emit frequent status updates.
  - Keep real newline-terminated findings and normal scrollback untouched.
  - For interactive PTY runs, keep the final visible frame available so users can still inspect the last terminal state, even when progress/status redraw lines are excluded from searchable saved transcript text.
  - For normal runs, prefer command-specific noise classifiers over global suppression so raw output stays faithful while search, findings, summaries, and previews become easier to use.

- **Run comparison enhancements**
  - Future-state enhancements after the v1 history-row comparison flow has real use.
    - Finding-level diffs using persisted signal/finding metadata:
      - New findings.
      - Disappeared findings.
      - Unchanged findings.
      - Changed severity or changed metadata.
    - Tool-aware diffs for common scanner outputs:
      - `nmap`: ports, protocols, services, versions, and state changes.
      - URL/status/title lists: new URLs, disappeared URLs, status changes, title changes.
      - Subdomain lists: new and disappeared names.
      - TLS/certificate output: issuer, subject, SAN, validity, and fingerprint changes.
    - Keep tool-aware parsers additive; raw changed/added/removed output should remain the fallback.
  - Future entry points and packaging:
    - Active tab `Compare` action for restored/completed runs.
    - Findings strip action such as `Compare findings with previous run`.
    - Workflow provenance in comparison summaries once workflow-linked runs exist.
    - Project baseline compare once projects exist.
    - Snapshot/permalink compare if the run-vs-run model continues to work well.
    - `Export comparison` once share/export packages have a stable artifact model.
  - Future UX/testing:
    - Consider date-range filters in the manual compare picker if day grouping plus `Load More` is not enough for deep history.
    - Add Playwright coverage for the compare launcher/result flow on desktop and mobile after the UI settles.
    - Add focused large/noisy comparison regression coverage if real-world outputs expose performance issues beyond current backend and unit coverage.

- **Bulk history operations**
  - The history drawer can delete all or delete non-favorites. Adding multi-select (checkbox mode) with bulk delete, bulk export to JSONL/txt, and bulk share would close a real gap when clearing out a session after an engagement or exporting selected findings.

- **Autocomplete suggestions from output context**
  - When a previous command's output is in the active tab, `| grep` completions could suggest patterns already present in that output — IP addresses, hostnames, status codes, CVE strings — as candidates alongside the generic flag list.
  - Narrow but would make the pipe stage feel predictive rather than generic.

- **Mobile share ergonomics**
  - The native share-sheet for permalink URLs is done (v1.5, `navigator.share()` with clipboard fallback). What remains is making the broader mobile save/share experience feel intentional:
    - save/share actions tuned for one-handed use
    - clearer copy/share/export affordances inside the mobile shell
    - better share handoff after snapshot creation

## Architecture

- **Structured output model**
  - Preserve richer line/event details consistently for all runs.
  - This would improve search, comparison, redaction, exports, and permalink fidelity.
  - Command outcome summaries are buildable without this foundation, but design them so they can move onto the structured model later. Summary parsers should consume structured line events, not re-parse raw text forever.

- **Unified terminal built-in lifecycle**
  - Browser-owned built-ins (`theme`, `config`, and `session-token`) need browser execution for DOM state, local storage, clipboard, and transcript-owned confirmations, while server-owned built-ins naturally flow through `/runs`.
  - The long-term cleanup target is one terminal-command lifecycle after execution:
    - normalize built-in output into a shared result shape
    - apply pipe helpers against that shape
    - mask sensitive command arguments once
    - render transcript output once
    - persist server-backed history once
    - load recents and prompt history from the same saved run model
  - Keep execution ownership separate where it matters, but remove duplicated recents/history/pipe/persistence glue so browser-owned and server-owned built-ins cannot drift.

- **Plugin-style helper command registry**
  - Turn the built-in command layer into a cleaner extension point for future app-native helpers.

- **Lightweight Jinja base template**
  - `index.html`, `permalink_base.html`, and `diag.html` now all share the same ~10 lines of `<head>` bootstrap (charset, viewport, color-scheme meta, favicon, `fonts.css`, `styles.css`, theme var includes, and the two vendor scripts). With three templates the duplication is starting to pay for the indirection.
  - A `base.html` factoring out the common `<head>` and `data-theme` body attribute would prevent drift and make adding a fourth page type trivial.

- **Interactive PTY transport future-state**
  - Revisit whether the current Redis-brokered SSE plus POST input/resize transport should move to WebSockets after real use.
  - The current model keeps deployment simple and avoids a WebSocket runtime, but a bidirectional socket could reduce input latency and simplify the modal terminal stream once PTY usage grows.
