# Architecture & Decision Log

This document captures the key architectural decisions, bugs encountered, and reasoning behind implementation choices made during the development of darklab shell. It is intended as a durable decision log for anyone picking up this project — particularly for use with AI coding assistants like Claude Code that can read the codebase but not the conversation history.

The Python backend is split into focused modules with acyclic dependencies:

```
config.py        — CFG defaults, SCANNER_PREFIX (no app dependencies)
    ↑
logging_setup.py — GELFFormatter, _TextFormatter, configure_logging(cfg)
    ↑
helpers.py     — trusted-proxy IP resolver, session-ID extractor
database.py    — SQLite connect/init/prune
process.py     — Redis setup, pid_register/pid_pop
permalinks.py  — Flask context/render helpers for permalink pages
templates/     — Jinja templates for the main shell, permalink pages, and focused repro harnesses
run_output_store.py — preview/full-output capture and artifact helpers
export_html.js — shared browser-side HTML export helpers for tab downloads and permalink save HTML
    ↑
extensions.py  — Flask-Limiter singleton (limiter.init_app deferred to app.py)
    ↑
blueprints/
  assets.py    — /vendor/*, /favicon.ico, /health, /diag (IP-gated)
  content.py   — /, /config, /themes, /faq, /autocomplete, /welcome*, /repro/mobile-keyboard
  run.py       — /run (rate-limited SSE), /kill; run-output capture helpers
  history.py   — /history*, /share*; preview-output shaping helpers
    ↑
app.py         — Flask factory: logging setup, limiter.init_app(app),
                 blueprint registration, before/after-request hooks, 429 handler

commands.py    — Command validation and rewrites (no CFG dependency, standalone)
fake_commands.py — Synthetic shell helpers for /run
```

`commands.py` is a pure-function module with no dependency on Flask or other app modules, making it straightforward to import and test in isolation. Each blueprint imports by name from the modules it depends on (`from commands import is_command_allowed`) so that mock patches in tests target the namespace where the function actually resolves its internal calls.

`fake_commands.py` sits alongside that path and provides a small web-shell helper layer for shell-like commands that should be useful in the UI without spawning a real process. `/run` checks that layer before allowlist validation and process launch. Today it handles `banner`, `clear`, `date`, `env`, `faq`, `fortune`, `groups`, `help`, `history`, `hostname`, `id`, `last`, `limits`, `ls`, `man`, `ps`, `pwd`, `reboot`, `retention`, `status`, `sudo`, `tty`, `type`, `uname -a`, `uptime`, `version`, `which`, `who`, and `whoami`, plus exact-match guardrail easter eggs for `rm -fr /` and `rm -rf /`. Most of the commands are intentionally synthetic in implementation but presented as web-shell helpers: they surface app-specific state like the allowlist, runtime limits, configured FAQ entries, and session history, return stable environment strings, or trigger UI-native behavior like clearing the current tab. `faq` now merges the built-in FAQ set first and appends any `faq.yaml` entries after it, and custom entries can use the same lightweight markup supported by the modal renderer: bold, italics, underline, inline code, bullet lists, and clickable command chips that load into the prompt. `ps` is intentionally half-synthetic: it shows the current `ps` invocation with a fake PID, then recent completed session commands with separate exit/start/end columns but no PID so they read as completed work, not active processes. `man <topic>` is the other exception: for allowlisted real commands it renders the real system man page, while `man <fake-command>` reuses the helper descriptions instead of rejecting the topic. Runtime command availability is now checked in the shared command layer, so fake commands and normal allowlisted `/run` commands both return the same clean instance-level message when a required binary is missing. Dispatch is handled by the module-level `_FAKE_COMMAND_DISPATCH` dict, which maps each root name to a lambda normalised to `(cmd, sid) -> list[dict]`; `execute_fake_command()` resolves the root, looks up the handler, and delegates — adding a new helper command means adding one entry to the dict rather than extending a branch chain.

`logging_setup.py` depends only on `config.py` and the standard library. It must be imported and `configure_logging(CFG)` called before any other local import in `app.py` — `process.py` attempts a Redis connection at module-import time and emits log records then, so the logger must already be configured with the correct formatter and level when those calls fire.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Real-time Output: SSE over WebSockets

Server-Sent Events (SSE) were chosen over WebSockets for output streaming. SSE is simpler to implement with Flask, works correctly behind nginx-proxy without additional configuration, and is unidirectional (server → client) which is all that's needed for streaming command output. The frontend reads the SSE stream via `fetch()` + `ReadableStream` rather than the `EventSource` API, because `EventSource` doesn't support custom headers (needed for the session ID).

### Multi-worker Process Killing via Redis

**Problem:** Gunicorn runs 4 workers, each with isolated memory. A kill request could hit a different worker than the one that started the process.

**Approaches tried:**
- In-memory dict — fails immediately (isolated memory per worker)
- `multiprocessing.Manager` shared dict — tried and abandoned; unreliable after Gunicorn forks workers due to broken IPC socket connections under load
- SQLite `active_procs` table — worked correctly but was a misuse of a relational database for ephemeral process state; required a `DELETE FROM active_procs` purge on every startup to clear stale rows from crashes

**Solution:** Redis keys — `SET proc:<run_id> <pid> EX 14400`. Every worker reads and writes the same Redis instance. `GETDEL` (Redis 6.2+) provides an atomic get-and-delete, preventing race conditions between workers. The 4-hour TTL (`EX 14400`) replaces the startup purge — orphaned entries self-expire rather than requiring cleanup on init.

**Fallback for local dev:** If `REDIS_URL` is not set, the app falls back to `memory://` for rate limiting and a `threading.Lock` + in-process dict for PID tracking. This is correct for single-process development (`python3 app.py`) but breaks under Gunicorn multi-worker mode — use Docker Compose for multi-worker testing.

**Critical timing fix:** `Popen` and `pid_register` must happen *before* `return Response(generate(), ...)`. Flask generators are lazy — the generator body doesn't execute until Flask starts streaming. If `pid_register` is inside the generator, a kill request arriving before streaming starts finds nothing in Redis and silently fails.

### Structured Logging

**Problem:** The original `logging.basicConfig(...)` in `app.py` had two issues:
1. It was called after local imports, so `process.py`'s module-level Redis connection log fired before the formatter was installed, producing either no output (Python's lastResort suppresses INFO) or the wrong format.
2. All log records were plain strings, incompatible with GELF structured log aggregation.

**Solution:** `logging_setup.py` provides two formatters and a `configure_logging(cfg)` function. In `app.py`, `configure_logging` is called immediately after `from config import CFG` and before all other local imports. This guarantees the logger is ready before `process.py` (or any other module) imports and logs at module scope.

The `shell` logger is configured with `propagate = False` so records don't double-emit to the root logger. Werkzeug's own request lines are suppressed (`logging.getLogger("werkzeug").setLevel(ERROR)`) because request logging is handled by `before_request` / `after_request` hooks instead.

**Formatters:**

- `GELFFormatter` — emits compact GELF 1.1 JSON. `short_message` is a bare event name (e.g. `RUN_START`); all context is in `_`-prefixed additional fields. This gives Graylog direct indexable fields (`_ip`, `_run_id`, `_cmd`) without any extraction rules.
- `_TextFormatter` — human-readable `2026-04-02T10:00:00Z [INFO ] EVENT  key=value ...` lines. Extra fields are sorted alphabetically and appended after the event name. String values containing spaces are repr-quoted.

Both formatters use a shared `_extra_fields(record)` helper that extracts caller-supplied fields from the LogRecord (anything not in `_STDLIB_ATTRS` and not underscore-prefixed).

**Log event inventory:**

| Level | Event | Where | Key extra fields |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| DEBUG | `REQUEST` | before_request | ip, method, path, qs |
| DEBUG | `RESPONSE` | after_request | ip, method, path, status, size |
| DEBUG | `KILL_MISS` | kill_command | ip, run_id |

| INFO  | `DIAG_VIEWED` | diag() | ip |
| WARN  | `DIAG_DENIED` | diag() | ip, allowed_cidrs |
| WARN  | `UNTRUSTED_PROXY` | get_client_ip | ip, proxy_ip, forwarded_for, path |
| WARN  | `RATE_LIMIT` | errorhandler(429) | ip, path, limit |
| WARN  | `CMD_TIMEOUT` | generate() | ip, run_id, session, timeout, cmd |
| WARN  | `KILL_FAILED` | kill_command | ip, run_id, pid, error |
| WARN  | `HEALTH_DEGRADED` | health() | db, redis |
| ERROR | `RUN_SPAWN_ERROR` | run_command | ip, session, cmd (+ traceback) |
| ERROR | `RUN_STREAM_ERROR` | generate() | ip, run_id, session, cmd (+ traceback) |

| ERROR | `HEALTH_DB_FAIL` | health() | (+ traceback) |
| ERROR | `HEALTH_REDIS_FAIL` | health() | (+ traceback) |

**Timing note:** `client_ip` is captured once at the top of `run_command()` as a local variable before the `generate()` closure is defined. This avoids a hidden dependency on Flask's request context being active when the generator body runs during streaming. The same `client_ip` local is closed over in `generate()`.

### Rate Limiting via Redis

**Problem:** Flask-Limiter with its default `memory://` backend gives each Gunicorn worker its own independent counter. With 4 workers, a user effectively gets 4× the configured limit before being rate-limited — the `rate_limit_per_minute` setting in config.yaml becomes meaningless under load.

**Solution:** Redis as the shared backend via `storage_uri=REDIS_URL` in the `Limiter` constructor. All workers increment the same counter in Redis, so the configured limit is enforced accurately across the entire process pool.

Request identity now follows an explicit trusted-proxy allowlist (`trusted_proxy_cidrs`) instead of honoring arbitrary `X-Forwarded-For` from direct clients. If a request arrives from outside the trusted ranges, the app falls back to the direct peer IP and logs the proxy IP so operators can see which Docker bridge, reverse proxy, or local forwarding hop needs to be added.

This is what motivated the Redis addition in the first place. Once Redis was a dependency for rate limiting, it became the natural fit for PID tracking too (replacing the SQLite `active_procs` workaround).

### Cross-User Process Killing

**Problem:** Gunicorn runs as `appuser`, commands run as `scanner`. Linux won't let `appuser` signal `scanner`-owned processes.

**Solution:** `sudo -u scanner kill -TERM -<pgid>`. The sudoers rule `appuser ALL=(scanner) NOPASSWD: ALL` covers this. The kill sends to the entire process group (negative pgid) to catch child processes spawned by the shell.

**PGID capture timing:** The `/kill` endpoint stores the subprocess PID at spawn time and uses it directly as the PGID (`pgid = pid`) rather than calling `os.getpgid(pid)` at kill time. Since all subprocesses are spawned with `preexec_fn=os.setsid`, PGID equals PID at creation, making the stored PID a safe stand-in. The alternative — calling `os.getpgid()` after `proc.wait()` has reaped the process — returns the PGID of whatever new process reused that PID. If that new process is a freshly spawned Gunicorn worker (workers and scanner subprocesses draw from the same kernel PID pool), `kill -TERM -<worker_pgid>` sends SIGTERM to the entire Gunicorn worker pool.

### Two-User Security Model

- **`appuser`** — runs Gunicorn, owns `/data` (chmod 700), can write SQLite
- **`scanner`** — runs all user-submitted commands via `sudo -u scanner env HOME=/tmp`, no write access to `/data`

`HOME=/tmp` is critical. Without it, `sudo` resets HOME to `/home/scanner` which doesn't exist on the read-only filesystem. Tools like nuclei, wapiti, and subfinder all write to `$HOME` at startup and will fail with "read-only filesystem" errors without this.

### Startup Sequence (entrypoint.sh)

Container starts as root → `entrypoint.sh` runs → fixes `/data` ownership (Docker volume mounts reset ownership to the host user) → sets `/tmp` to `1777` → pre-creates `/tmp/.config/nuclei`, `/tmp/.config/uncover`, `/tmp/.cache` owned by scanner → `gosu appuser gunicorn ...`

**Why `gosu` instead of `su`?** `su` forks an extra process; `gosu` does `exec` which replaces the process, giving Gunicorn PID 1 semantics.

**Why `init: true` in docker-compose?** When Gunicorn is PID 1, orphaned child processes in a scanner subprocess chain are reparented to the Gunicorn master. Scanner commands run as a chain — `sudo → env → sh → tool` — and when the group receives SIGTERM all four processes die simultaneously. If an intermediate parent exits before the leaf process, the leaf becomes an orphan and is adopted by PID 1 (Gunicorn). If that tool exits with a non-zero code (e.g. `wpscan` returns 3 for "potentially interesting findings"), Gunicorn's `reap_workers()` collects it via `waitpid(-1)` and interprets `exit(3)` as `WORKER_BOOT_ERROR`, shutting the entire server down. `init: true` adds Docker's bundled tini init as PID 1; Gunicorn starts as PID 2+, and any orphaned scanner processes are silently reaped by tini without reaching Gunicorn at all.

**Why pre-create `/tmp/.config`?** Without this, the first tool that tries to create it (e.g. nuclei on startup) runs as `scanner`, but the directory doesn't exist yet. If anything root-level touches `$HOME` before the user switch completes, it creates `/tmp/.config` owned by root with `700`, and `scanner` can never write to it.

### nmap Capabilities

nmap requires `CAP_NET_RAW` and `CAP_NET_ADMIN` for OS fingerprinting and SYN scans. Rather than running the container privileged:

```
setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip /usr/bin/nmap
```

This grants the capabilities to the binary itself — any user who executes nmap gets them for the duration of that process only. `docker-compose.yml` must also have `cap_add: [NET_RAW, NET_ADMIN]` or the host kernel won't make those capabilities available to the container.

The `--privileged` flag (nmap's own flag, not Docker's) is auto-injected by `rewrite_command()` so users don't need to add it. Without it, nmap falls back to limited scan modes even with the capabilities set.

### Go Binary Installation

All Go tools (`nuclei`, `subfinder`, `httpx`, `dnsx`, `gobuster`) are installed with `ENV GOBIN=/usr/local/bin` in the Dockerfile. This puts binaries directly in `/usr/local/bin` with world-executable permissions, accessible to the `scanner` user. Without this, Go installs to `/root/go/bin` which is root-owned and inaccessible to `scanner`. Previous symlinks from `/root/go/bin/` to `/usr/local/bin/` also fail because symlinks inherit the target's permissions issue.

`httpx` is renamed to `pd-httpx` via `mv` after install to avoid shadowing the Python `httpx` library that `wapiti3` pulls in as a dependency.

### SQLite WAL Mode

SQLite is configured in WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode with `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL`. This allows concurrent reads during writes, which is important with 4 Gunicorn workers all reading/writing the same database simultaneously. The `db_connect()` function applies these pragmas on every connection.

Startup bootstrap is still serialized explicitly. `database.py` calls `db_init()` at module import time, so all Gunicorn workers can reach schema creation, migration, and retention pruning concurrently during boot. `_db_init_lock()` takes an exclusive filesystem lock on `/data/history.db.init.lock` (or the `/tmp` fallback) so that import-time bootstrap work happens once at a time and workers do not fail with `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`.

### Path Blocking (/data and /tmp)

Commands referencing `/data` or `/tmp` as filesystem paths are blocked at validation time using the regex `(?<![\w:/])/data\b` (and `/tmp`). The negative lookbehind `(?<![\w:/])` prevents false positives on URLs — `https://darklab.sh/data/` won't match because `/data` is preceded by `m`.

Blocking happens at two layers: client-side (immediate feedback) and server-side (authoritative). Internal rewrites (e.g. `nuclei -ud /tmp/nuclei-templates`) are injected by `rewrite_command()` which runs *after* `is_command_allowed()`, so they bypass the check.

### Loopback Address Blocking

Commands containing loopback addresses (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `[::1]`) anywhere in the command string are blocked at validation time by `_LOOPBACK_RE` in `commands.py`. The regex uses word-boundary anchors (`\b`) so hostnames like `notlocalhost.com` are not caught.

**Why this matters:** the web shell runs commands as the `scanner` user inside the container. Without this block, a user could submit `curl http://localhost:8888/diag` or `curl 127.0.0.1:8888/config` as a command and reach internal Flask endpoints directly. This is not prevented by the `/diag` CIDR gate alone, since connections from inside the container arrive as `127.0.0.1` and would pass any gate that includes that address.

Three complementary layers enforce the restriction:

1. **Server-side regex** (`commands.py` `_is_command_allowed`) — authoritative; catches any tool and any URL form (bare hostname, with port, with scheme, etc.)
2. **Allowlist deny entries** (`conf/allowed_commands.txt`) — client-side feedback for the most obvious bare-hostname patterns (`!curl localhost`, `!curl 127.0.0.1`, etc.)
3. **iptables rule** (`entrypoint.sh`) — OS-level TCP block for the `scanner` uid on the app port; fires before the Flask app sees the request and covers tools that bypass command validation (e.g. scripting languages)

The iptables rule is added by `entrypoint.sh` as root before the `gosu` drop. It uses `REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset` so connections from the scanner user fail immediately rather than timing out. The `|| true` ensures the rule failure does not abort startup in environments where `xt_owner` is unavailable.

### Deny Flag Matching (anywhere in command)

Allow-listed tools can have specific flags blocked via `!`-prefixed deny entries in `conf/allowed_commands.txt`. Early implementations only matched the deny entry as a prefix of the command — `!curl -o` would catch `curl -o /tmp/out` but not `curl -s -o /tmp/out` where other flags precede the denied one.

`_is_denied()` tokenizes both the incoming command and the deny entry using the shared `split_command_argv` helper. Tool names and subcommand prefixes are compared case-insensitively; flags are compared with exact case, so `!curl -K` (disable TLS verification, uppercase) does not fire on `curl -k` (lowercase). For short combined flags (`-sU`), `_flag_matches_token` checks whether the denied flag letter appears within the token, so `!nmap -sU` catches `-sU`, `-UsT`, and other combinations. The tool prefix must still match first, so `!gobuster dir -o` only fires for `gobuster dir` subcommand invocations, not `gobuster dns`.

**`/dev/null` exception:** a denied output flag is allowed when its argument is `/dev/null` (e.g. `curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}" <url>`). This is a common pattern for checking HTTP response codes without writing to the filesystem. The exception checks for `flag /dev/null\b` immediately after the flag match.

## Command Auto-Rewrites

These happen in `rewrite_command()` silently (no user-visible notice unless specified):

| Command | Rewrite | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `mtr` | Adds `--report-wide` | mtr requires a TTY for interactive mode; report mode works without one. User is shown a notice. |
| `nmap` | Adds `--privileged` | Required for raw socket features with setcap. Silent. |
| `nuclei` | Adds `-ud /tmp/nuclei-templates` | Redirects template storage to tmpfs. Silent. |
| `wapiti` | Adds `-f txt -o /dev/stdout` | wapiti writes reports to file by default; this streams to terminal. Silent. |

---

## Frontend Architecture

Modular frontend with no build step. `index.html` is a 169-line HTML shell — no inline styles or scripts. Styles live in `static/css/styles.css`; logic is split across `static/js/` into focused modules loaded via plain `<script src="...">` tags. Load order matters: the shared store lives in `state.js`, DOM-facing helpers live in `ui_helpers.js`, `app.js` provides shared browser helpers, and `controller.js` loads last to perform the initialization and event wiring. No bundler, no transpilation.

Within that non-module shell, repeated tab/history/FAQ-limit surfaces are built with direct DOM node creation instead of stitched HTML strings, and the template’s modal chrome now uses class-based wrappers for hidden state and dialog layout. That keeps the render paths more maintainable without changing the page composition model.

External dependencies: local vendor routes backed by build-time font downloads and a copied-in `ansi_up` browser build for ANSI-to-HTML rendering. `ansi_up` is self-hosted — the checked-in browser-global file at `static/js/vendor/ansi_up.js` serves as the fallback for local dev and docker-compose runs. The Dockerfile copies that same file into `/usr/local/share/shell-assets/js/vendor/ansi_up.js`, which the app serves through `/vendor/ansi_up.js`. The same pattern is used for fonts under `/vendor/fonts/`, with repo copies in `app/static/fonts/` acting as fallbacks.

**JS module load order:** `session.js` → `state.js` → `utils.js` → `config.js` → `dom.js` → `ui_helpers.js` → `tabs.js` → `output.js` → `search.js` → `autocomplete.js` → `history.js` → `welcome.js` → `runner.js` → `app.js` → `controller.js`. `state.js` owns the shared store boundary, `ui_helpers.js` owns DOM-facing setters/getters and visibility helpers, `app.js` still provides reusable browser helpers, and `controller.js` owns the composition root and must load last so it can wire the DOM after all helpers are defined. `welcome.js` must precede `runner.js` because `runner.js` calls `cancelWelcome()` at the top of `runCommand()`.

### Shared Frontend State Layer

The browser scripts share a single state layer in `app/static/js/state.js`. That module loads immediately after `session.js` and installs `Object.defineProperty` accessors on `globalThis`, so the legacy global-style code can keep reading and writing plain names while the actual storage lives in one central object. DOM-centric helpers were split into `app/static/js/ui_helpers.js`, which keeps the state boundary smaller without forcing an ES-module migration.

That choice keeps the codebase free of a larger ES-module migration while still making the shared state explicit. It also keeps the unit-test harness simple: the jsdom loader can seed `state.tabs` and `state.activeTabId` before evaluating the browser scripts, then prepend `ui_helpers.js` before DOM-bound modules so the extracted scripts see the same helper globals as production without rewriting the production call sites.

### Dedicated Mobile Shell

The mobile UI still uses a dedicated shell rooted at `#mobile-shell` with explicit `chrome`, `transcript`, `composer`, and `overlays` mounts. The difference now is that the shell was deliberately simplified back to a normal-flow layout after a focused repro proved the Firefox mobile bug was coming from the app’s integration layer, not from the browser itself.

The current shape is intentional:

- `#tab-panels` is still reparented into the mobile transcript mount at runtime so output rendering stays shared while the mobile surface gets its own container.
- `#mobile-shell` stays in normal document flow instead of pinning the whole mobile terminal with fixed-shell viewport math.
- `#mobile-composer-host` uses in-flow `margin-bottom: var(--mobile-keyboard-offset)` spacing to clear the on-screen keyboard, rather than page-scroll resets, `visualViewport` pan compensation, or body-level transforms.
- Mobile input focus is user-driven; the code no longer relies on synthetic focus handlers on the composer host or lower hit area because those were a major source of scroll jumps and transient bad frames on Firefox mobile.
- Overlays are mounted into a separate mobile overlay area so the shell can manage menu, history, FAQ, and options surfaces independently of the desktop wrapper.

The key architectural decision here is negative: the app no longer tries to outsmart the mobile browser with page-scroll correction or fixed full-shell keyboard choreography. Those experiments made the Firefox keyboard bug worse. The stable model is closer to a normal mobile document with a dedicated composer block at the bottom of the shell.

To make that debugging path repeatable, `content.py` also serves `/repro/mobile-keyboard`, backed by `templates/mobile_keyboard_repro.html`. That page is a stripped-down control harness for mobile keyboard/composer behavior and now serves as the reference surface when future mobile keyboard regressions appear.

This keeps the mobile surface structured without needing a separate frontend bundle or framework split, while preserving the simplified layout that fixed the Firefox mobile issue.

**Why not ES modules (`type="module"`)?** ES modules are deferred by default and each runs in its own scope, which would require explicit `export`/`import` everywhere. The plain script approach shares a single global scope — simpler and sufficient for this scale.

### Shell Prompt Model

The visible command surface is terminal-native:

- a hidden real `#cmd` input remains the source of truth for browser/mobile keyboard input, selection, and focus
- a rendered prompt row is mounted into the active tab output and mirrors the hidden input value/caret/selection
- the prompt unmounts while a command is running and remounts when the run finishes/fails/is killed
- submitted commands are echoed as styled prompt lines in output so transcript flow reads like a real shell
- blank/whitespace `Enter` does not call `/run`; it appends a new prompt line
- `Ctrl+C` maps to shell-like behavior: open kill confirm while running, otherwise emit a fresh prompt line

On mobile, the prompt surface is split into a dedicated visible composer:

- `#mobile-cmd` is the visible source-of-truth input on touch-sized viewports
- the helper row with `Home`, `←`, `→`, `End`, and `Del Word` appears only while the mobile keyboard is open
- command chips, autocomplete acceptance, and the Run/Enter paths all sync back to the visible mobile input so the desktop mirror stays in step
- the desktop and mobile Run buttons stay disabled together while any command in the active tab is running, preventing duplicate submits from either surface
- mobile keyboard-open state is driven by the visible mobile input when it exists, with a viewport-offset fallback for the legacy/mobile-shell test harness path

This keeps browser editing semantics and accessibility predictable without relying on `contenteditable`.

### Tab State

Each tab is an object: `{ id, label, command, runId, runStart, exitCode, rawLines, killed, pendingKill, st, draftInput }`.

- `command` — the command associated with this tab, set both when the user runs a command directly and when a tab is created by loading a run from the history drawer; used for dedup when clicking history entries (if a matching tab already exists, that tab is activated)
- `runId` — the UUID from the SSE `started` message, used for kill requests
- `runStart` — `Date.now()` timestamp set *after* the `$ cmd` prompt line is appended, so the prompt line itself has no elapsed timestamp
- `rawLines` — array of `{text, cls, tsC, tsE}` objects storing the pre-`ansi_up` text with ANSI codes intact; `tsC` is the clock time (`HH:MM:SS`), `tsE` is the elapsed offset (`+12.3s`) relative to `runStart`. Used for permalink generation and HTML export
- `killed` — boolean flag set by `doKill()` to prevent the subsequent `-15` exit code from overwriting the KILLED status with ERROR
- `pendingKill` — boolean flag set when the user clicks Kill before the SSE `started` message has arrived (i.e. `runId` is not yet known); the `started` handler checks this and sends the kill request immediately
- `st` — current status string (`'idle'`, `'running'`, `'ok'`, `'fail'`, `'killed'`); set synchronously by `setTabStatus()` so `runCommand()` can check it without waiting for the async SSE `started` message
- `draftInput` — unsaved command text that the user was composing in this tab; flushed from `cmdInput.value` on tab switch and restored via `setComposerValue(..., { dispatch: false })` when the tab is reactivated. Not saved for running tabs (the command was already submitted). The `controller.js` input handler also keeps this field live on every keystroke so the flush at switch time is always consistent.

Tab switching is draft-preserving: `activateTab` in `tabs.js` saves the leaving tab's current input as `draftInput`, then restores the arriving tab's saved draft into the prompt without triggering an input event (which would reopen autocomplete). It also calls `acHide()` and resets `acFiltered = []` so stale suggestions from the leaving tab's session cannot bleed into the arriving tab. `resetCmdHistoryNav()` is also called on switch to clear the command-history cursor.

### Live Output Rendering

Fast output bursts are rendered in small batches instead of forcing a full DOM update per line. The batching keeps commands like `man curl` responsive enough for the browser to repaint while output is streaming, and the terminal stays pinned to the bottom only while the user has not scrolled away. If the user scrolls up, live following stops until they return to the tail.

### Output Prefixes: Line Numbers And Timestamps

Elapsed and clock timestamps are shown on output lines without rebuilding those line nodes. Each appended `.line` receives two timestamp `data-` attributes plus a synchronized `data-prefix` string:

- `data-ts-e` — elapsed offset from `tab.runStart` (e.g. `+12.3s`)
- `data-ts-c` — wall-clock time (e.g. `14:32:01`)
- `data-prefix` — compact shared prefix text such as `12 +3.4s`, `12 14:32:01`, or just `12`

`appendLine()` stores the timestamp metadata at insert time, and `syncOutputPrefixes()` in `output.js` recomputes `data-prefix` plus a shared `--output-prefix-width` per output container whenever rows are appended or the timestamp / line-number mode changes. CSS still renders the visible prefix through `::before`, but the actual text composition happens in JavaScript so line numbers, timestamps, prompt rows, and exit rows all stay aligned as digit widths change.

Welcome-animation rows are excluded from prefix numbering entirely. They keep their original boot-sequence layout, and the first real output line after welcome still becomes line `1`.

`tab.runStart` is set *after* the `$ cmd` prompt line is appended so the prompt itself has no `data-ts-e` attribute and shows no elapsed stamp.

### Welcome Animation

`welcome.js` exposes `runWelcome()`, `cancelWelcome(tabId?)`, `requestWelcomeSettle(tabId?)`, and tab-ownership helpers around a single startup experience that runs after `app.js` creates the initial tab. The current sequence is broader than the original typeout, and it has a desktop branch plus a mobile branch:

1. fetch `/welcome/ascii` and stream the ASCII banner from `conf/ascii.txt`
2. render fake startup-status rows using `APP_CONFIG.welcome_status_labels`
3. pause briefly using `welcome_post_status_pause_ms` so the boot phase lands before the example phase begins
4. fetch `/welcome` and sample a curated set of commands from `conf/welcome.yaml` using `welcome_sample_count`
5. show the first prompt, let it idle for at least `welcome_first_prompt_idle_ms`, then type the featured example
6. attach click and keyboard handlers to the sampled command text and the featured `TRY THIS FIRST` badge so they load into the prompt without executing
7. fetch `/welcome/hints` and rotate footer hints while the welcome tab is still idle, using `welcome_hint_interval_ms` and `welcome_hint_rotations` (`0` keeps rotating until interrupted; `1` keeps the first hint static)

On touch-sized viewports the same timing/config pipeline runs with `/welcome/ascii-mobile` and `conf/ascii_mobile.txt`, but the sampled-command phase is skipped so the mobile welcome stays abbreviated while still showing the desktop-style status and rotating hint rows.

The implementation still types character-by-character using short timed waits, but it now mixes in overlapping loading spinners for the status rows, a staged handoff into the first prompt, and hint rotation that continues until the user interrupts it or the configured limit is reached.

Welcome ownership is tab-scoped. `runWelcome()` records a `welcomeTabId`, and teardown only happens when the action targets that same tab. That avoids the old cross-tab bug where running a command or clearing output in some other tab could wipe the welcome content. `runCommand()` checks whether the active tab is the welcome owner before clearing, and clear/close actions do the same.

Welcome settle behavior is intentionally keyboard-friendly: printable typing, `Escape`, and `Enter` all fast-forward the active welcome sequence to its settled state.

`load_welcome()` now accepts richer blocks from `conf/welcome.yaml`:

- `cmd` — required
- `out` — optional sample output, trimmed with `.rstrip()` so leading indentation survives
- `group` — optional category bucket used for curated sampling
- `featured` — optional boolean used to bias the primary sample and show the badge

The route shape is intentional. Frontend-facing config content is exposed through narrow, typed endpoints rather than a generic “serve files from `conf/`” handler:

- `/faq` for the canonical FAQ dataset (built-ins first, then `faq.yaml` entries)
- `/autocomplete` for `auto_complete.txt`
- `/welcome` for sampled command metadata from `welcome.yaml`
- `/welcome/ascii` for plain-text banner art from `ascii.txt`
- `/welcome/ascii-mobile` for the mobile banner art from `ascii_mobile.txt`
- `/welcome/hints` for hint strings from `app_hints.txt`
- `/config` for normalized values from `config.yaml`

That keeps parsing and validation on the server side and lets the file format evolve without coupling the browser directly to raw config files.

### Starring / Favorites

Starred commands are stored in `localStorage['starred']` as a JSON array of command strings treated as a Set. Star state is keyed by command text (not run ID) so starring "nmap -sV google.com" applies to every run of that command in both the history chips row and the full history drawer.

`_toggleStar(cmd)` loads the set, adds or removes the entry, and saves it back. `renderHistory()` (chips) and `refreshHistoryPanel()` (drawer) both sort starred entries to the top before rendering. The `☆` / `★` icons in chips and the `☆ star` / `★ starred` buttons in the drawer update optimistically without a full re-render.

When starring a command from the history drawer, if the command is not already in `cmdHistory` (the in-memory chips list), it is prepended and the list is trimmed to `recent_commands_limit`. This means a command that was never run in the current session — e.g. one from a previous container session that only appears in the SQLite history — becomes immediately accessible as a chip after being starred, without requiring the user to run it first.

`cmdHistory` is also hydrated on startup from `/history` via `hydrateCmdHistory()` in `history.js`. That matters for keyboard recall: blank-input `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` navigation now works on first load from persisted history, not only after a command has been run in the current browser tab.

### Ctrl+R Reverse-History Search

`Ctrl+R` in the command prompt activates a reverse-i-search mode backed by `history.js`. The implementation is a self-contained section of four functions exported as globals (keeping the classic-script architecture):

- `enterHistSearch()` — saves the current input as `_histSearchPreDraft`, clears the prompt (without dispatching an input event so autocomplete does not reopen), and shows `#hist-search-dropdown`.
- `exitHistSearch(accept, { keepCurrent })` — if `accept` is true, fills the prompt with the selected match; if `keepCurrent` is true, leaves whatever is in the prompt; otherwise restores `_histSearchPreDraft`. Always calls `acHide()` to ensure autocomplete cannot reopen regardless of the exit path.
- `handleHistSearchInput(value)` — updates `_histSearchQuery` and re-renders the dropdown. Does **not** call `setComposerValue` during typing — the typed query stays in the prompt, the dropdown shows matching history entries.
- `handleHistSearchKey(e)` — full key handler: `Escape`/`Ctrl+G` restores the pre-search draft; `Enter` accepts the selected match (or runs the typed query when there are no matches) and calls `submitComposerCommand`; `Tab` accepts without running; `ArrowDown`/`ArrowUp` step through matches and fill the prompt with the highlighted entry; `Ctrl+R` cycles to the next match; `Ctrl+C` exits with `keepCurrent: true` so the typed query remains and the pre-draft is not restored. Returns `true` to signal handled.

`controller.js` routes `Ctrl+R` to `enterHistSearch()` and, while in search mode, sends all `keydown` events through `handleHistSearchKey` first and all `input` events through `handleHistSearchInput` before the normal handlers run.

DOM: `#hist-search-dropdown` in `index.html`; `histSearchDropdown` reference in `dom.js`; CSS in `styles.css`.

### Autocomplete Dropdown Ordering and Navigation

The suggestion list always renders items top-to-bottom in their natural `acFiltered` order regardless of whether the dropdown appears above or below the prompt. Earlier code reversed the list and flipped `ArrowDown`/`ArrowUp` direction when the `ac-up` CSS class was present; that logic was removed so navigation direction is consistent in both positions.

Navigation wraps around: `ArrowDown` at the last item cycles back to the first (`(acIndex + 1) % acFiltered.length`); `ArrowUp` at the first item or with no selection (`acIndex <= 0`) cycles to the last (`acFiltered.length - 1`). The Ctrl+R hist-search dropdown uses identical wrap logic.

### The KILLED Race Condition

When a user clicks Kill:
1. `doKill()` sets `tab.killed = true`, shows KILLED status
2. Server receives SIGTERM, process exits with code -15
3. SSE stream sends `exit` message with code -15
4. Exit handler checks `tab.killed` — if true, skips status update and resets flag

Without the `killed` flag, the `-15` exit code causes the exit handler to set status to ERROR, briefly flashing KILLED before reverting.

### Config Loading

The frontend fetches `/config` on page load and stores it in `APP_CONFIG`. This is used for `app_name`, `project_readme`, `prompt_prefix`, `default_theme`, `motd`, `recent_commands_limit`, `max_output_lines`, the welcome timing values, `welcome_first_prompt_idle_ms`, `welcome_post_status_pause_ms`, `welcome_sample_count`, `welcome_status_labels`, `welcome_hint_interval_ms`, and `welcome_hint_rotations`. Theme is only applied from config if no `localStorage` preference exists — user choice always wins. `project_readme` is used by the built-in FAQ and synthetic README-style helper output so those links can be branded per deployment without changing code.

Theme styling is resolved from the named YAML variants under `app/conf/themes/`, loaded by `app/config.py`, injected into the page through `theme_vars_style.html` and `theme_vars_script.html`, and then consumed by the CSS, runtime theme selector modal, `/themes` endpoint, and export helpers. On mobile the selector opens as a full-screen chooser with a two-column preview layout on wider phones so the preview cards stay readable while keeping each grouped section the same width. Each YAML variant may provide an optional `label:` field; that label is what the selector preview card shows, `group:` controls the modal section header, and `sort:` controls the order inside the preview grid while the filename stem remains the persisted theme name. Theme values can also reference other resolved theme vars with CSS `var(--name)` syntax, and the browser resolves those references after injection. The `default_theme` setting in `app/conf/config.yaml` uses the full filename for operator copy/paste convenience, and the loader normalizes it to the registry entry. The root `app/conf/theme_dark.yaml.example` and `app/conf/theme_light.yaml.example` files are copyable templates only; they are not part of the runtime selector. Runtime theme resolution prefers `localStorage.theme`, then `default_theme` from `app/conf/config.yaml`, and finally the baked-in dark fallback palette in `app/config.py`. The result is a single theme source of truth for both live rendering and downloadable HTML snapshots. This completed theme externalization work belongs to the v1.4 line. See [THEME.md](THEME.md) for the full walkthrough and the complete appendix of theme keys.

### Theme System

The theme implementation is intentionally split so the operator-facing config, live UI, permalink pages, and exported HTML all read from the same resolved values:

1. `app/conf/themes/` holds the selectable named variants that the runtime preview modal can expose without code changes.
2. `app/conf/theme_dark.yaml.example` and `app/conf/theme_light.yaml.example` are copyable templates only and are not loaded into the runtime selector.
3. `app/config.py` merges those YAML overrides with `_THEME_DEFAULTS`, exposes the current theme as runtime CSS vars, and builds the selectable theme registry. If a theme file has a `label:` field, that becomes the friendly selector label; otherwise the filename stem is humanized. The registry keeps the stem as the persisted theme name, but also exposes the filename so `default_theme` can be written as a full `*.yaml` path fragment in config. Theme values are passed through as literal CSS strings, so `var(--...)` references and other CSS functions survive the YAML load unchanged and resolve in the browser.
4. `app/templates/theme_vars_style.html` injects the resolved variables as CSS custom properties so `styles.css` can use `var(--name)` everywhere.
5. `app/templates/theme_vars_script.html` publishes the same resolved values plus the registry as `window.ThemeRegistry` and `window.ThemeCssVars` so browser-side theme selection and export helpers can build downloadable HTML without a duplicate hardcoded palette.
6. `app/app.py` exposes `/themes` so the frontend and tests can inspect the available registry.
7. `app/static/js/app.js` exposes the theme helpers and `app/static/js/controller.js` applies the selected theme on the fly via the dedicated theme selector modal preview cards, updates cookies/localStorage, and keeps the shell chrome consistent while switching.
8. `app/static/js/export_html.js` consumes the injected values and embeds them into saved HTML exports, keeping the downloaded file portable and theme-consistent.

### Dependency Version Tracking

Dependency freshness is handled separately from runtime config:

1. `scripts/check_versions.sh` gives a quick local snapshot of pinned Python requirements versus the newest published version it can find, Node devDependencies from `package.json` / `package-lock.json`, plus the Docker base image line read directly from `Dockerfile` while ignoring prerelease tags like alpha and rc builds.
2. The same script also checks pinned Go, pip, and gem tool versions inside `Dockerfile` so build-time tools can be compared against the Go module proxy, PyPI, and RubyGems without having to read the file by hand. For `go install .../cmd/...` lines, it resolves the Go module root from the Dockerfile import path before querying the proxy. The script accepts `--python-only`, `--node-only`, `--docker-only`, `--go-only`, `--pip-only`, `--gem-only`, and `--debug` so you can isolate a single surface while debugging version drift.
3. Docker Scout is the last step for the built image itself, since base-image freshness is easiest to verify after the image is built.

The goal is to keep local inspection easy while still having a container-image-specific check for deployments.

In GitLab CI, the `dependency-version-check` job is exposed as a manual run in pipelines and stores the output as a short-lived artifact, which makes it easy to spot stale base images or pinned Python packages during routine maintenance.

After a Dockerfile or package upgrade, `tests/py/test_container_smoke_test.py` (invoked via `scripts/container_smoke_test.sh`) is the primary verification step. The fixture reads `examples/docker-compose.standalone.yml`, resolves build paths, builds a unique base image with `docker build --pull`, creates a temporary runtime container from that image, copies the repo `app/` tree plus a generated `config.local.yaml` into `/app`, commits that as a runtime image, and writes a temporary compose file that runs the committed image with no client-side bind mounts. It then starts the service with `docker compose up -d`, discovers the real published host port with `docker compose port`, waits for `/health`, and submits every command from `app/conf/auto_complete.txt` through `/run`, checking each against the stored expectations in `tests/py/fixtures/container_smoke_test-expectations.json`. Focused unit regressions in the same module verify `_docker_reach_host()` and compose-port parsing so DinD jobs keep probing the daemon host and the actual published port instead of hard-coding `127.0.0.1` or guessing a free localhost port from the wrong namespace. A failure means a tool is missing, broken, or producing unexpected output in the upgraded image. If a tool's output has intentionally changed, re-capture the baseline first with `scripts/capture_container_smoke_test_outputs.sh` against a known-good running container.

GitLab CI mirrors that same smoke test in the `container-smoke-test` job, which is exposed as a manual run in pipelines when you want to verify a fresh image before merging dependency or Dockerfile changes.

This design replaced the older pattern of duplicating theme values in separate template/JS snippets. The current arrangement keeps the live shell, permalink pages, and export HTML aligned without making the export depend on the app being online after download. This completed v1.4 theme refactor is documented in [THEME.md](THEME.md), which contains the full appendix of configurable keys and defaults.

Not every `config.yaml` key is exposed to the browser. Server-side persistence controls such as `persist_full_run_output` and `full_output_max_mb` stay backend-only because the frontend does not need to know them to render the normal tab or history flows. The MB value is converted to bytes internally before any artifact truncation logic runs.

### Session Identity

An anonymous UUID is generated in `localStorage` on first visit and sent as `X-Session-ID` header on every API call. History and run data is scoped to this session. It's not authentication — just isolation between browser sessions.

## Known Gotchas & Lessons Learned

**Gunicorn generator laziness.** Any setup that must happen before a kill request can arrive (Popen, pid_register) must be outside the generator function passed to `Response()`. The generator only executes when Flask starts iterating it to stream bytes.

**wpscan (and similar tools) exits with code 3 as a normal status.** wpscan returns 3 to mean "potentially interesting findings found" — not a crash. When Gunicorn runs as PID 1 (via `gosu` exec), that exit code from an orphaned subprocess triggers `WORKER_BOOT_ERROR` in `reap_workers()` and halts the server. Fix: `init: true` in docker-compose. See Startup Sequence above.

**Scanner subprocess chains can orphan their leaf process.** `SIGTERM` sent to the process group kills all four processes (`sudo`, `env`, `sh`, `tool`) simultaneously. If the intermediate parents die first, the leaf tool briefly has no parent and is adopted by PID 1. With `init: true`, PID 1 is tini, not Gunicorn, so the adoption is benign.

**Docker volume mount ownership.** Bind-mounting `./data:/data` resets the directory's ownership to the host user who created it. The `entrypoint.sh` `chown -R appuser:appuser /data` corrects this on every start. The `-R` is important — `history.db` itself may also be root-owned if it was created by a previous run as root.

**`multiprocessing.Manager` and fork.** Python's `multiprocessing.Manager` starts a background server process. When Gunicorn forks workers, the Manager proxy objects in the child processes can lose their connection to the Manager server under load. This manifested as intermittent kill failures — some processes couldn't be killed because their PIDs weren't visible to the worker handling the kill request. SQLite is more reliable here.

**sudo resets HOME.** `sudo -u scanner` resets the `HOME` environment variable to the target user's home directory from `/etc/passwd`. For `scanner` (a no-login system user) this is `/home/scanner`, which doesn't exist on the read-only filesystem. All tools that write config/cache to `$HOME` fail. The fix is `sudo -u scanner env HOME=/tmp` to explicitly set HOME before the command runs.

**nmap --privileged vs Docker --privileged.** These are different things. nmap's `--privileged` flag tells nmap to assume it has raw socket access. Docker's `--privileged` gives the container full host access. We use nmap's flag (auto-injected) combined with `setcap` on the binary and `cap_add` in compose — not Docker's privileged mode.

**`env` doesn't use `--` as a terminator.** `sudo -u scanner env HOME=/tmp -- sh -c "..."` fails because `env` treats `--` as a literal command name. The correct form is `sudo -u scanner env HOME=/tmp sh -c "..."`.

**ansi_up and permalink colors.** ansi_up converts ANSI escape codes to HTML spans, consuming the original codes. If you try to re-render from `element.innerText`, all color information is lost. The `rawLines` array stores the original text before ansi_up processes it, enabling the permalink page to run ansi_up fresh and reproduce the exact same colors.

**`vendor/` routes must exist for local dev.** `ansi_up.js` is served through `/vendor/ansi_up.js`, with the copied-in asset living outside `/app` and the repo file as a fallback. If you run the app locally without Docker and the fallback file doesn't exist, the script tag 404s, `AnsiUp` is undefined, and `appendLine()` crashes before the fetch to `/run` fires. The symptom is: tab label updates (it runs before `appendLine`) but no command output and nothing in the server logs — the fetch never happens. Fix: keep `app/static/js/vendor/ansi_up.js` in place or copy it into `/usr/local/share/shell-assets/js/vendor/ansi_up.js` in Docker.

**SSE via fetch vs EventSource.** `EventSource` doesn't support custom request headers. Since we need `X-Session-ID` on every request, we use `fetch()` with a `ReadableStream` reader instead. This requires manually parsing the SSE format (`data: ...\n\n`) from the raw byte stream.

**Multi-tab stall detection requires per-tab state.** The SSE stall detector fires if no data arrives within 45 seconds. The original implementation used a single module-level `_stalledTimeout` variable. With multiple tabs running commands simultaneously, starting a command in Tab B would cancel Tab A's timeout, leaving Tab A's stalled connection undetected indefinitely. Fixed by replacing the single variable with a `Map` keyed by `tabId` (`_stalledTimeouts = new Map()`). All four call sites (`_resetStalledTimeout`, `_clearStalledTimeout`, and their consumers in the SSE loop and kill handler) must pass `tabId`.

**Command timeout must fire during continuous output.** The original timeout check was inside the `select()` idle branch — it only ran when no output had arrived for `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` seconds. A command producing a constant stream of output (e.g. a flood scan before deny rules were added) would never hit the idle branch and therefore never time out. Fix: moved the timeout check to the top of the `while True:` loop so it runs on every iteration regardless of output activity. The start time is parsed once outside the loop (`datetime.fromisoformat(run_started)`) to avoid repeated parsing overhead.

**HTTP/1.1 browser connection limit (local dev only).** Browsers cap concurrent HTTP/1.1 connections per origin at 6. Each running command holds one persistent SSE connection. With multiple app UI tabs each running a command, it's possible to saturate the limit, causing new page loads (JS files etc.) to stall. In production this is a non-issue — nginx-proxy terminates HTTPS, and HTTP/2 multiplexes all requests over a single connection with no per-origin cap. In local dev (bare Gunicorn, no proxy, HTTP/1.1), you can hit this limit with enough concurrent tabs. A local Caddy proxy (`brew install caddy`) resolves it if needed.

## Test Suite

Tests live in `tests/py/` at the repo root (not inside `app/`). `conftest.py` `chdir`s to `app/` and inserts it into `sys.path` before import so `app.py` can find its relative-path assets (`templates/`, `conf/`, etc.) and app modules are importable.

Current totals:

- `pytest`: 762
- `vitest`: 282
- `playwright`: 135
- total: 1,179

### Testing Architecture

- The project uses a three-layer test strategy:
  - `pytest` for backend contracts, route behavior, persistence, loaders, and logging
  - `Vitest` for client-side helpers and DOM-bound browser logic in jsdom
  - `Playwright` for the integrated browser UI against a live Flask server

- That split is deliberate. Backend coverage stays fast and deterministic, browser-module logic gets isolated without bundling the app, and only browser-specific integration risks are left to Playwright.

- The browser JS remains non-module global-scope code, so Vitest uses `tests/js/unit/helpers/extract.js` to load selected functions from each script into an isolated execution context with `new Function(...)`. That keeps the production client architecture unchanged while still allowing targeted unit coverage. The page bootstrap moved into `app/static/js/controller.js`, while shared state now lives in `app/static/js/state.js` and DOM-facing helpers live in `app/static/js/ui_helpers.js`; the extracted scripts still depend on the globals defined by the earlier scripts.

- `app/static/js/state.js` now also owns the shared composer store (`composerState`) with explicit value, selection, and active-input accessors. `setComposerValue()` now writes to the visible active input only, and the mobile selection / history / autocomplete paths publish through the shared store instead of mirroring one DOM input into the other. The state store and helper layer are now the single source of truth for composer value/selection, which makes the later cursor/edit-helper phases much smaller.

- The jsdom harness mirrors production load order by prepending `app/static/js/state.js` and `app/static/js/ui_helpers.js` before the script under test. `tests/js/unit/helpers/extract.js` also supports an optional `initCode` block so tests can seed `tabs` / `activeTabId` before evaluating module code, which keeps `getTab()` and `getActiveTab()` aligned with the real browser state.

- The new shared composer store is covered in isolation by `tests/js/unit/state.test.js`. That file checks the store accessors and reset behavior without touching DOM inputs, and the jsdom/mobile tests now assert that mobile composer writes stay on the active input instead of mirroring into the hidden desktop field.

- Phase 3 of the composer-state migration completed the remaining input-publishing cleanup: focus and `selectionchange` events now publish into `composerState`, the hidden-input mirroring helper is gone, and the remaining composer-side regression coverage now exercises the active-input publish path directly.

- Phase 4 of the composer-state migration moved the cursor and mobile edit helpers onto shared composer state, so caret movement now follows `composerState` instead of stale DOM selection and the mobile edit bar can adjust the active input without reviving hidden-input mirroring.

- Phase 5 of the composer-state migration moved the controller keydown and submit paths onto shared composer state as well, so `controller.js` and `runner.js` no longer treat `cmdInput.value` as the global composer source during Enter/shortcut handling. The controller now reads the active composer value through the shared store before key handlers submit, mutate, or inspect prompt text.

- Phase 6 of the composer-state migration made tab draft persistence and history-search interactions state-first too: tab switches now capture the shared composer value for `draftInput`, autocomplete and recent-chip updates continue to render from the active composer state, and hist-search restore / accept flows now feed the shared store before submitting or rehydrating the prompt.

- Phase 7 of the composer-state migration moved `syncShellPrompt` onto shared composer state, so the prompt render now reads value and selection from `composerState` instead of whichever DOM input happens to be current. That keeps the shell prompt rendering correct across desktop typing, mobile typing, tab switching, and history/search restores without relying on hidden-input state.

- Phase 8 of the composer-state migration removed the leftover dead mirroring branches and tightened the mode-coupled helpers around the shared store boundary. `tabs.js`, `history.js`, and the controller no longer fall back to the inactive input just to keep the mirrored prompt state alive; `getVisibleComposerInput()` remains only as a focus/render helper, not as a second source of truth.

- A small stylesheet regression guard in `app.test.js` now asserts that `#mobile-composer-host` stays free of keyboard-height spacing in the simplified shell, so the stale mobile gap cannot silently creep back in during later tuning.

- A mobile output-follow regression in `app.test.js` now asserts that the active tab stays pinned to the bottom when the keyboard opens, which keeps the last line visible while the simplified mobile shell is resizing around the composer.

- Search highlighting now walks text nodes and clones the line structure instead of rewriting serialized `innerHTML`, which keeps mixed-content lines and helper markup intact while preserving plain-text search, regex search, case sensitivity, and current-match navigation. A related initialisation fix in `ui_helpers.js` sets the search bar's inline `display` style to `none` on load so the `.u-hidden` utility class correctly hides it regardless of the `.search-bar { display: flex }` rule that follows it at equal specificity; `isSearchBarOpen()` was also tightened to check `=== 'flex'` instead of `!== 'none'`.

- Playwright runs with `workers: 1` by design. `/run` rate limiting is per session, so parallel browser workers create false failures rather than meaningful concurrency coverage. Recent browser regressions are captured in the suite for mobile shell visibility and tab-row behavior, tab isolation, permalink preference cookies, close-running-tab / clear-preserve behavior, and history-panel action-button close behavior.

- The Firefox mobile keyboard investigation added a durable test/control split: `/repro/mobile-keyboard` now has route coverage in `test_routes.py`, while `app.test.js` locks the main shell to the simplified mobile-shell DOM structure, the “no programmatic mobile focus” behavior, and shared desktop/mobile Run-button disable rules for both typed and programmatic composer updates.

- The permalink/export refactor exists to remove duplicated static HTML/CSS/JS and to centralize shared page chrome and export styling in reusable templates/helpers. The live permalink page and the downloadable export should stay maintainable together without carrying separate copies of the same presentation code.

- Backend tests deliberately keep the same relative-path assumptions as production. `tests/py/conftest.py` changes into `app/` before imports so routes and loaders resolve `templates/`, `conf/`, and related assets exactly the way the running app does. The configuration loader now supports sibling `*.local.*` overlays across the checked-in config assets in `app/conf/` and `app/conf/themes/` so operators can keep private overrides out of git while leaving the checked-in files as the portable base layer.

- Suite-specific coverage inventories, focused run commands, and maintenance notes are intentionally centralized in [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) rather than duplicated here.

## Database

`./data/history.db` — SQLite, WAL mode. Three persistent tables plus file-backed run-output artifacts:

- `runs` — one row per completed command. Stores run metadata plus a capped `output_preview` JSON payload for the history drawer and `/history/<id>`. Fresh previews now store structured `{text, cls, tsC, tsE}` entries so run permalinks can preserve prompt echo and timestamp metadata. Persists across restarts. Pruned by `permalink_retention_days`.
- `run_output_artifacts` — metadata rows pointing at compressed full-output artifacts under `./data/run-output/`. This keeps the `runs` table lean while still allowing the canonical `/history/<id>` permalink to serve full output when it exists.
- `snapshots` — one row per tab permalink (`/share/<id>`). Contains `{text, cls, tsC, tsE}` objects with raw ANSI codes and timestamp data for accurate HTML export reproduction.

The storage model is intentionally split:

- live tabs and normal history restore use `max_output_lines` and the `runs.output_preview` payload, which keeps only the most recent preview lines
- full-output persistence is controlled by backend-only config keys `persist_full_run_output` and `full_output_max_mb`
- `full_output_max_mb` is multiplied by `1024 * 1024` and enforced on the uncompressed UTF-8 stream before gzip compression, so the limit tracks output volume rather than the final on-disk `.gz` size
- full-output artifacts for fresh runs are stored as gzip-compressed JSON-lines records, not plain text, so prompt/timestamp/class metadata can be reused by canonical run permalinks
- the main-page permalink button now upgrades to the persisted full artifact when one exists, so `/share/<id>` and `/history/<run_id>` both surface the same complete result when available
- artifact readers stay backward-compatible with older plain-text gzip artifacts by normalizing them into structured `{text, cls, tsC, tsE}` entries at load time
- deleting a run, clearing history, or retention pruning removes both the DB metadata and any associated artifact files

Active process tracking (`run_id → pid`) was previously a third table (`active_procs`) cleared on startup. It has been replaced by Redis keys with a 4-hour TTL (see Multi-worker Process Killing above).

## Infrastructure Notes (darklab.sh specific)

The production `docker-compose.yml` includes:
- `nginx-proxy` + `acme-companion` for SSL termination via `VIRTUAL_HOST` / `LETSENCRYPT_HOST`
- GELF logging to Graylog via UDP
- External Docker network `darklab-net`

None of these are required to run the app. The `examples/docker-compose.standalone.yml` strips all of this out for a clean standalone deployment.
